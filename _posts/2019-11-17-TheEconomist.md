<h3 id="1.1">Aircraft-carriers are under threat from modern missiles</h3>

“NO PIECE OF hardware better exemplifies America’s military might than an aircraft-carrier,” declare the memoirs of Ashton Carter, America’s defence secretary in 2015-17. Nor does any other piece of hardware so plainly exemplify what is wrong with America’s military thinking. Aircraft-carriers are the largest and most expensive machines in the history of warfare. A new American Ford-class ship costs $13bn—more than the annual defence budget of Poland or Pakistan. However, as precision missiles become faster, more accurate and more numerous, these beasts look increasingly like giant floating targets. 

Although America has by far the world’s largest `fleet`<sup>舰队</sup> of carriers—11 of the full-sized sort, plus half a dozen smaller ones—their appeal is global, and growing. China’s first domestically built carrier will be commissioned within months. Britain’s second modern carrier began its sea trials in September. Even pacifist Japan is converting two destroyers to carry jets, for the first time since the second world war. 

Aircraft-carriers have proved their worth in recent years. Many armed forces watched admiringly as American naval jets did the lion’s share of bombing in the early months of war in Afghanistan in 2001 and Iraq in 2003 (and again in 2014). Land bases were often unavailable because of awkward geography or `recalcitrant`<sup>不服从命令的</sup> allies. 

But the seas off enemy shores look ever less safe. Russia and China are both developing long-range missiles that are manoeuvrable and accurate enough to hit large ships at sea. China’s DF-21D, an anti-ship ballistic missile that can travel over 1,500km (950 miles), is already a threat. Several countries are building cheaper anti-ship cruise missiles, which fly shorter distances but can be launched from planes. Anti-ship missiles are growing in range, precision and number. By one estimate, an American naval force within 2,000km of China might have to `parry`<sup>回避</sup> 640 incoming weapons in a single salvo. 

Though guiding such missiles onto a distant moving target is tricky, no navy will be keen on putting several billion dollars and thousands of sailors in peril. Carriers have become too big to fail. As a result, they will probably have to remain at least 1,000km away from shore, a distance that their warplanes cannot cross without refuelling. That could have grave implications for America’s ability to project power across the Pacific—and so for all its allies (see Briefing). Carriers will also have to be cocooned with destroyers and frigates, which will absorb most of the resources of smaller navies, like those of Britain and France. 

Carriers are not entirely [`obsolete`]( "Something that is obsolete is no longer needed because something better has been invented. 被淘汰的")<sup>淘汰</sup>. Most wars will not be great-power clashes. They will remain useful against foes which lack modern missile systems. Even in intense conflicts, warships will require air power to protect them from the predations of enemy ships and aircraft. As long as navies have surface ships, they will want to be able to fly planes above them. 

But what sort of planes? Even as missiles force carriers farther offshore, the average combat range of their air wings has shrunk, from 2,240km in 1956 to around 1,000km today. (Modern munitions travel farther, but do not make up the difference.) The obvious remedy is to use drones that can fly longer, riskier missions than human pilots, allowing their host carriers to keep a safe distance away. But the Pentagon unwisely scrapped its programme for such a drone in 2016, replacing it with one that would merely refuel inhabited planes. 

Aircraft-carriers, like the warplanes on them, belong to a class of large, vastly expensive weapons that military types call “exquisite”. A more homely approach to military technology is warranted. Smaller, cheaper and, where possible, unmanned systems could be procured in larger numbers, [`dispersed`](    "Things that are dispersed are situated in many different places, a long way apart from each other. 分散的")<sup>散布</sup> more widely and used more daringly. Such forces may lack the prestige of massive warships. But they are better adapted to a world in which the projection of military power is growing ever harder.

<h3 id="1.2">Public pensions are woefully underfunded</h3>

MANY WORKERS in the private sector no longer have them. But most public-sector employees in America are still entitled to a valuable benefit: a pension linked to their final salary. A long-standing problem is that states and cities, which fund their plans differently from the federal government, have been [`lax`]( "If you say that a person's behaviour or a system is lax, you mean they are not careful or strict about maintaining high standards. 松懈的; 不严格的") about putting aside enough money to cover these promises. 

The resulting black hole is becoming ever more alarming (see article). Although the American stockmarket has been hitting record highs, the average public-sector pension fund has a bigger deficit in percentage terms than it did in either 2000, or the start of this decade. In some states and cities schemes are less than 50% funded; Illinois has six of the worst. 

The cost of pension promises has risen because people are living longer, so they end up taking more out of the pot. Some states and cities have responded by trying to wriggle out of their obligations and cut the benefits retirees get, but courts have often decided against them, ruling that a contract is a contract. As a result states, cities and other public bodies are being forced to funnel ever more into pension schemes. Having chipped in the equivalent of 5.3% of their ordinary payroll bills in 2001, public-sector employers now pay in, on average, 16.5% a year. 

Even those contributions have not been enough. Politicians have often failed to pay in as much as the actuaries recommend. In 2009 the actuaries for the Illinois Teachers scheme asked the state to cough up $2.1bn; it paid just $1.6bn. By 2018 the annual bill had risen to $7.1bn but the state paid only $4.2bn. The hole in the pension scheme deepened to $75bn in 2018, or about $6,000 for every citizen in the state. And that is just for teachers. 

The problem could yet worsen. Pension schemes are vulnerable to a market downturn and many were left reeling after the global financial crisis of 2008-09. Even if markets do not tumble, they would suffer in a long period of sluggish returns. That looks plausible given that 30-year Treasury bond yields are just 2.4% and American equity valuations are stretched relative to their historical average. Some schemes are betting on “alternative assets” like hedge funds and private equity to fill the gap. But hedge-fund returns have been disappointing over the past decade, and the private-equity industry is not large enough to absorb $4trn of public-sector pension assets. 

And there is a final problem: the schemes’ accounting. When working out how much they need to put aside today, all funded schemes must calculate how much they are likely to pay out in future. This means using a rate to discount the cost of tomorrow’s pension payments. The higher the rate used, the lower the cost seems to be. Public-sector pension schemes are allowed to use the assumed rate of investment return as their discount rate, even though they will still have to pay pensions whether they earn that return or not. This has naturally led to a degree of optimism about future returns: many assume 7-7.5% a year. 

In the private sector, a pension promise is seen as a debt and has to be discounted at corporate-bond yields, which are at historically low levels. This makes pensions look more expensive and explains why many companies have closed their final-salary schemes. If the public sector had to use the same approach, its average funding ratio would be a lot lower than today’s 72% and the resulting hole, currently $1.6trn in total would be a lot bigger. 

Public bodies are going to have to boost their contributions even further. A study by the Centre for Retirement Research found that in the worst-affected states—Connecticut, Illinois and New Jersey—pension costs in 2014 were already 15% of total revenues. That will trigger a squeeze on the public finances, as other spending has to be cut or taxes have to be cranked up. Either will be especially hard on younger people and workers in the private sector, who do not get the same benefits. 

The pensions crisis has been rumbling on for years, but some states and cities will soon enter a downward spiral, in which pension costs lead to bad public services or tax rises, in turn encouraging workers and firms to move out, which then shrinks the tax base, making promises even less affordable. When that happens some states and cities will tumble into a black hole.

Correction (November 15th): A previous version of this article stated that the hole in public-sector pensions is $1.6bn. It is in fact $1.6trn. Sorry.

<h3 id="1.3">Voters could make the world twice as rich. Why don’t they?</h3>

IMAGINE YOU are offered a job at triple your salary. But first you must pass through a locked door, and someone with the key won’t open it. You might be willing to pay them to let you through. Whether this is fair or not is beside the point. They have the key and you don’t. If you gave them a portion of the increase in your wages, you would both be better off. 

This is not a bad analogy for global immigration policy. When migrants move from a poor country to a rich one, they typically make three to six times as much money as before (see our Special report in this issue). If everyone who wanted to migrate were allowed to do so, the world would by one estimate be twice as rich. Yet this vast gain cannot be realised, because most would-be migrants are forced to stay where they are. The door is locked, and voters in rich countries hold the key. 

Is there a way to open that door? Hardly anyone is considering it. Instead, the debate in rich countries veers between fearmongering and moralising. Nationalists, from Donald Trump, America’s president, to Viktor Orban, Hungary’s prime minister, portray immigrants as a threat to the culture, wages and even lives of the native-born. Pro-migration liberals, by contrast, are quick to dismiss those who disagree with them as racists, and mouth slogans that seem almost designed to alienate voters. Several Democrats in America talk not of reforming but of abolishing ICE, the agency enforcing immigration laws. 

A more pragmatic approach would be to think in terms of costs, benefits and how they might be distributed. The biggest beneficiaries of migration are the migrants themselves, who earn far more and in many cases escape from oppression or sexism. Their birthplaces benefit from the money they send home and the knowledge they bring back when they return, which usually more than makes up for any `“brain drain”`<sup>人才外流</sup>. 

The benefits to host countries are hefty, too. Skilled immigrants check pulses, write code and help local firms do business with their homelands. Migrants are twice as likely as the native-born to start a business and three times as likely to patent an idea. Blue-collar immigrants provide cheaper plumbing, child care and parcel deliveries. By one estimate, 83% of native-born rich-country workers benefit from immigration. Migrants may drag down the wages of native workers with similar skills, but the effect is so small that economists are not sure it exists. 

The biggest cost of migration is the hardest to measure. It is cultural. Many people like their societies the way they are. Some bristle when they hear foreign languages on the bus, or when a mosque replaces a pub. Since migrants tend to cluster, some places change uncomfortably fast. Such feelings are inflamed by `demagogues`<sup>煽动者</sup>, who wildly exaggerate the threat from a tiny minority of migrants—especially from crime. 

Overcoming these `objections`<sup>反对</sup> will be hard. But not impossible, if policymakers observe four principles. First, border control matters. Voters, perfectly reasonably, cannot abide chaos; governments must set and enforce the rules for who comes. Second, migrants must pay their way. Most already do, but it is crucial to design policies that encourage this, by making it easy for them to work and hard, at least for a while, to claim welfare benefits. 

Third, be creative. Australia’s “points-based” system is often praised, not least by some Brexiteers. It favours migrants who are young, English-speaking and have useful skills. It is quick, transparent and welcoming. At the same time Australia pitilessly excludes anyone who tries to enter without permission. Australians mostly support this system because they feel in charge of it. 

More market-based systems are also worth trying. Countries could auction visas to the well-heeled. In addition, for those who cannot yet afford to bid, they could allow more migrants in but apply surtaxes to their wages for a period, and transfer the money to citizens. If this is the price of entry, many migrants will choose to pay it. And if voters see an immigration dividend, they may find that new mosque does not bother them as much. 

Fourth, pace matters more than absolute levels. Political resistance to migrants spikes with sudden surges in immigration. In 2015 net immigration to Germany more than doubled to almost 1.2m, leading to a backlash. Yet the share of the population that is foreign-born is 16%, compared with 29% in Australia. This shows that a country with sensible policies can be almost two times as open to migration as Germany without even a hint of the disaster that nativists predict. On the contrary, Australia has a lower homicide rate than Germany, its people live longer and it has not had a recession since 1991. Many Australians grumble about `congestion`<sup>拥挤</sup> in the cities most popular with migrants, but this is fixable with the taxes those migrants pay. 

If the flow is steady and orderly, and if the newcomers are encouraged to support themselves and adapt to the host culture, immigration can be higher than most rich countries allow today. Singapore is 45% foreign-born, and a byword for prosperous tranquility. Countries can open up incrementally, with conditions, and reverse course if they choose. 

Today’s anti-migrant mood makes all this seem unlikely. Far from opening the door, many Western governments are double-locking it. Yet this creates an opportunity for others to snaffle the best brains repelled by chauvinism, to lure the most [`enterprising`]( "An enterprising person is willing to try out new, unusual ways of doing or achieving something. 有开拓精神的; 有创新精神的") migrants, and once again to become lands of opportunity.

<h3 id="1.4">Was there a coup in Bolivia?</h3>

THERE ARE few more emotive words in Latin America than “coup”, and for good reason. From 1930 to the 1970s, the region suffered the frequent overthrow of civilian governments in often bloody military `putsches`<sup>起义</sup>. The victims were usually of the left. In 1954 a moderate reforming government in Guatemala was ousted in the name of anti-communism by the CIA. Other coups followed, including that of General Augusto Pinochet against Salvador Allende, a radical socialist, in Chile in 1973. 

Since the democratisation of the region in the 1980s, coups have been rare. But the very idea has become a potent propaganda tool, especially for leftists. Scarcely a week goes by without Nicolás Maduro, Venezuela’s fraudulently elected dictator, claiming that he is threatened by one. Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua says the same. Dilma Rousseff, a leftist president in Brazil who spent her way to a second term in violation of the country’s fiscal responsibility law, also claims that her [`impeachment`]( "The impeachment of a senior official is the process of charging them with a crime that makes them unfit for office. 弹劾; 控告")<sup>弹劾</sup> in 2016 was “a coup” even though it followed strict constitutional procedures. 

The latest claim involves the fall of Evo Morales, Bolivia’s leftist president since 2006. He resigned on November 10th, fleeing into exile in Mexico. This prompted a chorus of denunciations of a coup from the Latin American left and even some European social democrats. This time, at least, the critics are wrong. 

True, Mr Morales’s term was not due to end until January. His fall followed violent protests and a mutiny by the police, who failed to suppress them. The final straw came when the head of the armed forces “suggested” that he quit. But that is to tell only a fraction of the story. 

Mr Morales, who is of Aymara [`indigenous`](    "Indigenous people or things belong to the country in which they are found, rather than coming there or being brought there from another country. 本土的; 当地的")<sup>本土的</sup> descent, long enjoyed broad popular support. He imposed a new constitution, which limited presidents to two terms. Thanks to the commodity boom and his pragmatic economic policy, poverty fell sharply. He created a more inclusive society. 

But he also commandeered the courts and the electoral authority and was often ruthless with opponents. In his determination to remain in power he made the classic strongman’s mistake of losing touch with the street. In 2016 he narrowly lost a referendum to abolish presidential term limits. He got the constitutional court to say he could run for a third term anyway. He then claimed victory in a dubious election last month. That triggered the uprising. An outside audit upheld the opposition’s claims of widespread irregularities. His offer to re-run the election came too late. 

Mr Morales was thus the casualty of a counter-revolution aimed at defending democracy and the constitution against electoral fraud and his own illegal candidacy. The army withdrew its support because it was not prepared to fire on people in order to sustain him in power. How these events will come to be viewed depends in part on what happens now (see article). An opposition leader has taken over as interim president and called for a fresh election to be held in a matter of weeks. There are two big risks in this. One is that ultras in the opposition try to erase the good things Mr Morales stood for as well as the bad. The other is that his supporters seek to `destabilise`<sup>使动摇</sup> the interim government and boycott the election. It may take outside help to ensure a fair contest. 

That the army had to play a role is indeed troubling. But the issue at stake in Bolivia was what should happen, in extremis, when an elected president deploys the power of the state against the constitution. In Mr Morales’s resignation and the army’s forcing of it, Bolivia has set an example for Venezuela and Nicaragua, though it is one that is unlikely to be heeded. In the past it was right-wing strongmen who refused to leave power when legally obliged to do so. Now it is often those on the left. Their constant invocation of coups tends to be a smokescreen for their own flouting of the rules. It should be examined with care.

<h3 id="1.5">Who will win the media wars?</h3>

AMERICA HAS seen some spectacular investment booms: think of the railways in the 1860s, Detroit’s car industry in the 1940s or the fracking [`frenzy`]( "Frenzy or a frenzy is great excitement or wild behaviour that often results from losing control of your feelings. 疯狂") in this century. Today the latest bonanza is in full swing, but instead of steel and sand it involves scripts, sounds, screens and celebrities. This week Disney launched a streaming service which offers “Star Wars” and other hits from its vast catalogue for $6.99 a month, less than the cost of a DVD. As the business model pioneered by Netflix is copied by dozens of rivals, over 700m subscribers are now streaming video across the planet. Roughly as much cash—over $100bn this year—is being invested in content as it is in America’s oil industry. In total the entertainment business has spent at least $650bn on acquisitions and programming in the past five years. 

This binge is the culmination of 20 years of creative destruction (see Briefing). New technologies and ideas have shaken up music, gaming and now television. Today many people associate economic change with deteriorating living standards: job losses, being ripped-off, or living under virtual monopolies in search and social networks. But this business blockbuster is a reminder that dynamic markets can benefit consumers with lower prices and better quality. Government has so far had little to do with the boom, but when it inevitably peaks the state will have a part to play, by ensuring that the market stays open and vibrant. 

The entertainment business is fast-moving by its very nature. It has few tangible assets, it relies on technology to distribute its wares and its customers crave novelty. The emergence of sound in the 1920s cemented Hollywood as the centre of the global film business. But by the end of the 20th century the industry had grown as complacent as a punchline in a repeat episode of “Friends”. It relied on old technologies—analogue broadcasting, slow internet connections and the storage of sounds and sights on fiddly CDs, DVDs and hard drives. And the commercial approach was to [`rip off`](  "If someone rips you off, they cheat you by charging you too much money for something or by selling you something that is broken or damaged. 宰人; 坑人") consumers by overcharging for `stale`<sup>不新鲜的</sup> content packaged into oversized bundles. 

The first shudder came in music in 1999, with internet services soon putting established music firms such as EMI and Warner Music under pressure. In television Netflix broke the mould in 2007 by using broadband connections to sell video subscriptions, undercutting the cable firms. When the smartphone took off it tailored its service to hand-held devices. The firm has acted as a catalyst for competition, forcing the old guard to slash prices and innovate, and sucking in new contenders. The boom has seen star writers paid as if they were Wall Street titans, sent rents for Hollywood studio lots into the stratosphere and overtook the 20th century’s media barons, including Rupert Murdoch, who sold much of his empire to Disney in March. 

Amid the [`debris`](    "Debris is pieces from something that has been destroyed or pieces of rubbish or unwanted material that are spread around. 碎片; 散乱的垃圾") and deals the outlines of a new business model are becoming clear. It relies on broadband and devices, not cable-packages, and overwhelmingly on subscriptions, not advertising. Unlike in search or social media, no firm in television and video streaming has more than a 20% market share by revenues. The contenders include Netflix, Disney, AT&T-Time Warner, Comcast and smaller upstarts. Three tech firms are active, too—YouTube (owned by Alphabet), Amazon and Apple, although their collective market share is still small. The music industry is also contested, with the biggest firm, Spotify, having a 34% market share in America. 

Disruption has created an economic windfall. Consider consumers, first. They have more to choose from at lower prices and can pick from a variety of streaming services that cost less than $15 each compared with $80 or more for a cable bundle. Last year 496 new shows were made, double the number in 2010. Quality has also risen, judged by the crop of Oscar and Emmy nominations for streamed shows and by the rising diversity of storytelling. Workers have done reasonably. The number of entertainment, media, arts and sports jobs in America has risen by 8% since 2008 and wages are up by a fifth. Investors, meanwhile, no longer enjoy abnormally fat profits, but those who backed the right firms have done well. A dollar invested in Viacom shares a decade ago is worth 95 cents today. For Netflix the figure is $37. 

Many booms turn to bust. Unlike, say, WeWork, most entertainment firms have a plausible strategy, but too much cash is now chasing eyeballs. Netflix is burning $3bn a year and would need to raise prices by 15% to break even—tricky when there are over 30 rival services. It hopes that its fast-growing international markets will create economies of scale. As well as saturation, the other danger is debt. Deals and high spending have caused American media firms to build up $500bn of borrowing. 

When the shake-out comes, history offers two dispiriting examples of how a consumer-friendly boom can turn into a `stitch-up`<sup>故意欺骗</sup>. Telecoms and airlines in America saw a riot of competition in the 1990s only to become financially stretched and then reconsolidated into `oligopolies`<sup>寡头</sup> that are known today for poor service and high prices. 

This is why government has a role in keeping the entertainment business competitive. First, it should prevent any firm—including the tech giants—from acquiring a dominant share in the content business. Second, it should require the companies that own the gateways to content, such as telecoms firms or handset providers such as Apple that can control what screens show—to have an open-access policy and not discriminate against particular content firms. Last, it should make sure subscribers can move their personal data from one firm to another, so they do not become locked in to one service. 

Few people look to Hollywood for economics lessons. But the entertainment epic has featured vibrant capital markets. Buy-out firms, stockmarkets and junk bonds have all financed the industry’s reinvention. The stars have been billionaire entrepreneurs such as Reed Hastings, Netflix’s boss. And open borders have set the scene, since talent comes from around the world and a majority of streaming subscribers now live outside America. Across the economy, these elements are at risk as politicians and voters veer away from open trade and free markets. For a reminder of why they matter, turn on your screen and press play.

<h3 id="2.1">Aircraft-carriers are big, expensive, vulnerable—and popular</h3>

IN 2016 THE Admiral Kuznetsov, Russia’s sole aircraft-carrier, spluttered north through the English Channel `belching`<sup>喷出</sup> thick black smoke. She was returning from an `ignominious`<sup>可耻的</sup> tour of duty in the Mediterranean. One of the 15 warplanes with which she had been pounding Syria had crashed into the sea; another had lurched off the deck after landing. When she finally `docked`<sup>停驻</sup> near Murmansk a 70-tonne crane smashed into her deck. 

The hapless Kuznetsov “is largely a white elephant with no real mission,” in the words of Michael Kofman, an expert on Russia’s armed forces. So why bother paying for the refit she has been undergoing ever since? “For the appearance”, says Mr Kofman, “of being a major naval power.” 

Floating runways have signified naval seriousness for most of the past century. Originally seen as a way to provide air cover for other ships, the second world war saw aircraft-carriers and their air wings become the main way that fleets fought with each other. That role was largely lost after 1945, as the Soviet Union was not a naval power; the heart of the cold war lay on central Europe’s plains and in third-world hinterlands. But despite the lack of a high-seas competitor America made its carriers `mightier`<sup>有力的</sup> still, using them to establish air superiority wherever it chose. 

Carrier planes flew 41% of America’s combat sorties in the Korean war and more than half of its raids on North Vietnam. In the first three months of the Afghan war in 2001, carrier-based jets mounted three-quarters of all strike missions. Two years later, when Turkey and Saudi Arabia refused to allow their territory to be used for attacks on Iraq, America deployed the combined might of five aircraft-carriers to mount 8,000 sorties in the first month of its invasion. When Islamic State blitzed through Iraq in 2014 the USS George H.W. Bush rushed from the Arabian Sea to the Gulf. For more than a month the only air strikes against IS were launched from its four catapults. 

The 11 supercarriers that America’s navy is required by law to have on its books make it a power like no other, able to fly fighters, bombers and reconnaissance aircraft wherever it likes without the need for nearby allies to provide airbases. The other countries with carriers capable of launching jet aircraft—Britain, China, France, India, Italy, Russia and Spain—make do with smaller and less potent vessels. But their numbers are increasing. Britain, India and China are all getting new carriers ready. Britain is settling for two; India aspires for three; China plans to have six or so by 2035. Japan is joining the club. In December 2018 it announced that it would convert its two Izumo-class destroyers to carry jets. 

Is this fashion for `flat-tops`<sup>航空母舰</sup> well advised? Carriers have long been threatened by submarines. During the Falklands war Argentina’s navy kept its only carrier skulking in port for fear of British submarines. Now they are increasingly threatened above the waterline, too, by ever more sophisticated land- and air-launched anti-ship missiles. To remain safe, carriers must stay ever-farther out to sea, their usefulness dropping with every nautical mile. Missile improvements also threaten the ability of the carriers’ air wings to do what is required of them, nibbling away at their very reason for being. 

“The queen of the American fleet...is in danger of becoming like the battleships it was originally designed to support: big, expensive, vulnerable—and surprisingly irrelevant to the conflicts of the time,” writes Jerry Hendrix, a retired American navy captain. Are the countries devoting vast sums to their carrier fleets making a colossal mistake? And if so, what does that mean for the way America projects its power and protects its allies? 

Americans like their aircraft-carriers large, like their cars and restaurant servings. They also insist on them being good. This makes them very expensive. When it was commissioned in 2017, the 100,000-tonne USS Gerald R. Ford, the first in a new class of carriers, became the priciest warship in history at $13bn. That is about what Iran spends on its entire armed forces each year, and almost twice what the George H.W. Bush, the last of the earlier Nimitz class of carriers, had cost a decade earlier. 

And that is before you sail or fly anything. In 1985, while he was making “Top Gun”, a jingoistic and intriguingly homoerotic paean to naval aviation, Tony Scott, a film director, was told that a single manoeuvre he wanted the USS Enterprise to make in order to get the perfect lighting would cost his studio $25,000. The annual cost of operating and maintaining a Nimitz-class carrier is $726m, not least because each has 6,000 people on board, almost twice as many as serve in the Danish navy. The planes cost a further $3bn-$5bn to [`procure`]( "If you procure something, especially something that is difficult to get, you obtain it. 获得 (尤指难以获得的东西)") and $1.8bn a year to operate. 

`Thriftier`<sup>节俭的</sup> countries do have other options. The 65,000-tonne HMS Queen Elizabeth (“‘Big Liz’, as we affectionately call her,” according to Britain’s defence minister in June), currently exercising with its F-35 jets in the North Atlantic, cost Britain under £5bn ($6.2bn) to build. The next in its class, HMS Prince of Wales, not yet commissioned, is said to be coming in a fifth cheaper. There is also a second-hand market for those willing to accept a few scuffs on the paintwork. China’s debut carrier, the Liaoning, began life as the half-built hulk of the Kuznetsov’s sister ship. It was sold by Ukraine to a Hong Kong-based tycoon for a paltry $20m. He shelled out a further $100m to move it to China. 

Yet even modestly sized carriers will inevitably `soak up`<sup>吸收</sup> a good proportion of stretched military budgets. The capital cost of the Ford amounts to less than 2% of America’s annual defence budget; the Queen Elizabeth represents about 15% of Britain’s. General Sir David Richards, who served as Britain’s chief of defence staff from 2010 to 2013, urged the government to cancel the Prince of Wales because “We could have had five new frigates for the same money.” Sir David’s successor, General Nick Houghton, complained in May that Britain would “rue the day” it had splashed out on both. “We cannot afford these things. We will be able to afford them only with `detriment`<sup>损害</sup> to the balance of the surface fleet.” 

It is one thing to be expensive. It is another to be expensive and fragile. In 2006 a Chinese Song-class diesel-electric submarine stalked the USS Kitty Hawk, a carrier, so silently while she was off Okinawa in the East China Sea that the first the Americans knew of it was when it surfaced just about 8,000 metres away. Getting that close would be harder in wartime, when the ships, subs and aircraft around a carrier would be more alert to undersea lurkers. But China is fielding ever more submarines. Modelling by the RAND Corporation has found that Chinese “attack opportunities”—the number of times Chinese subs could reach positions to attack an American carrier over a seven-day period—rose tenfold between 1996 and 2010. 

`Submarines`<sup>潜水艇</sup> do not have to get that close to do harm; they, like surface ships and aircraft, can also launch increasingly sophisticated anti-ship missiles from far afield. China’s H-6K bomber, for instance, has a range of 3,000km and its YJ-12 cruise missiles another 400km. This July, General David Berger, the head of America’s Marine Corps, published new guidelines which acknowledged that long-range precision weapons mean that “traditional large-signature naval platforms”—big ships that show up on radar—are increasingly at risk. 

The most frightening illustration of this threat is a 200-metre platform—roughly the length of a carrier deck—that sits in the Gobi desert. It is thought to be a test target for China’s DF-21D ballistic missile, a weapon that the Pentagon says is specifically designed to kill carriers. The DF-21D is a pretty sophisticated and pricey bit of kit. But Mr Hendrix calculates that China could build over 1,200 DF-21Ds for the cost of just one American carrier. A longer-range version, the DF-26, entered service in April 2018. 

According to a study by CSBA, a Washington think-tank, in future wars American carriers would have to remain over 1,000 nautical miles (1,850km) away from the coastlines of a “capable adversary” like China to stay reasonably safe. Any closer, and they could face up to 2,000 weapons in a single day. 

Carriers are not without defences. Their own aircraft can protect them from incoming bombers. The escort vessels around and below them ward off unfriendly submarines and shoot down incoming missiles. Aboard the USS Carney, a guided-missile destroyer of the sort that escorts carriers, Jamie Jordan, her combat-systems officer, insists that the navy is prepared: “It is instilled in us to train to those worst-case scenarios of saturation attacks.” Among the missiles in its launch tubes are some designed to shoot down incomers. But if faced with missiles launched in [`salvoes`](    "A salvo is the firing of several guns or missiles at the same time in a battle or ceremony. 齐射") 600 strong, as CSBA suggests, could even the best missile-defence systems keep up? 

What makes things worse is that aircraft range has shrunk just as missile ranges have grown (see chart). The air wings of the Top Gun era had an average range of about 1,700km. The Rafales on board France’s Charles de Gaulle today can still manage something similar. But the F-35s aboard American, British and Italian carriers, designed more for stealth than stamina, can reach nowhere near as far. Even when you add on the 500km range of the JASSM missiles the F-35 is armed with, American carriers attacking China would be well within being-struck range before they got their planes into strike range (see map). In-air refuelling can help, but it cuts the number of sorties a lot. And a repeatedly refuelled F-35 hitting a target almost 4,000km from its carrier could be `aloft`<sup>在空中</sup> for 12 hours—the very edge of what its lone human pilot could manage. 

This does not mean the age of the carrier is over. “A lot of these carrier-killing systems are essentially unproven,” says Nick Childs, an expert at the International Institute of Strategic Studies, a London think-tank. A missile that can fly the distance required is only one part of such a system. You also need eyes that can keep track of the prey. Ground-based radar cannot see targets hundreds of kilometres out to sea. Satellites can help, but they don’t give you data of high enough quality for the necessary precision, says Sidharth Kaushal, an expert at RUSI, another London think-tank. “They can tell you roughly where a carrier is, and possibly its bearing”. Bringing together different sorts of satellite and drone data to update targeting information on the fly will not be easy, not least because the target carrier’s bearing is unlikely to stay steady. Satellites can spot missile launches, too—and the Ford could travel more than four nautical miles in a new direction during the eight minutes it would take a DF-21D to reach it. 

America’s mighty carriers, surrounded by their protective battle groups and watched over by satellites, are more likely to survive a serious assault than the smaller carriers of other nations. This is in part because those smaller nations cannot afford fleets large enough to protect their carriers; trying to do so is already distorting their order of battle. A typical carrier strike group might tie up four or five `frigates`<sup>护卫舰</sup> and destroyers; the Royal Navy only has 19 such ships, the French even fewer. 

Mark Sedwill, Britain’s national-security adviser, says that a shortage of escorts is supportable because in combat the Royal Navy’s new carriers would “inevitably be used in the context of allied operations of some kind” if the threat were high. But, as the defence committee of Britain’s parliament has pointed out, it is not ideal to have flagships the country cannot use on its own: “Operating aircraft-carriers without the sovereign ability to protect them is [`complacent`](    "A complacent person is very pleased with themselves or feels that they do not need to do anything about a situation, even though the situation may be uncertain or dangerous. 自满的; 盲目乐观的") at best and potentially dangerous at worst.” 

If America is better able to defend its carriers, they are still becoming more vulnerable, and that matters more to America than to any other country. More or less since the Battle of Midway, it has relied on carrier-led naval forces to project power in Asia. In August a detailed report by the University of Sydney concluded that Chinese “counter-intervention systems” had contributed to a dramatic shift in the balance of power: “America’s defence strategy in the Indo-Pacific is in the throes of an unprecedented crisis”. If, in response to Chinese action against Taiwan, outlying Japanese islands or disputed territories in the South China Sea, American carriers looked on from half an ocean away, America’s reputation would crumble. If it steamed in, though, it could `conceivably`<sup>令人信服地</sup> see one sunk. 

One response to the problem of carriers being too large and vulnerable is making them smaller and `nimbler`<sup>更敏捷的</sup>. The guidance provided by General Berger of the marines explicitly calls for dispersal. But making the most of that possibility means changing what flies off the top. Stealthy unmanned planes could fly longer and riskier missions than human pilots, and survive higher accelerations. That would allow planes to get up close while their mothership kept well back. 

Alas, a culture that `venerates`<sup>崇敬</sup> aviators is resistant to change. Next year’s “Top Gun” sequel will not star a carrier-launched X-47B combat drone. It will star Tom Cruise, just as the original did. This is not just because the drone lacks a vulpine grin; the promising X-47B programme was cancelled in 2016. The Navy’s new drone is the MQ-25 Stingray, which will be restricted to demurely refuelling jets with pilots. “This is as short-sighted a move as I have seen Washington make on defence strategy decisions,” says Eric Sayers, a former consultant for America’s Indo-Pacific Command. 

It is also possible to respond to the vulnerability of carriers by doing more of what carriers used to do with missiles launched from lesser ships. The Tomahawk cruise missiles in the Carney’s vertical tubes can hit targets over 1,600km away. But unlike carriers, such vessels do not come with an air wing to ward off enemy planes. Even if the carrier is no longer doing the lion’s share of power projection, it might still have to protect the ships that take up that mantle. Perhaps in time it might do so with lasers; the nuclear reactors that power American carriers’ catapults and screws could also provide the megawatts that high-power lasers need. But as yet such weapons are aspirational. 

The result of all this is that carriers will only be fully effective against military minnows. “Most of the time, nations aren’t in a high-end fight with a peer competitor,” says Mr Kaushal, “but are competing for influence in third states, perhaps a civil war like Syria.” China appreciates that its own carriers would not survive for long in a scrap with America—but they might come in handy for cowing an Asian neighbour into `submission`<sup>投降</sup> or bombarding [`irksome`]( "If something is irksome, it irritates or annoys you. 烦人的; 讨厌的") rebels on some African coast. 

China also knows all too well that carriers offer an eye-catching way to show resolve. In 1996, when it rained missiles into the Taiwan Strait as a show of force, America sent two carrier groups into the region and one through the strait. That helped end the crisis—and spurred on China’s naval build-up. In recent times France and Britain have wielded their own carriers to demonstrate continued relevance in Asia. In a speech in Australia in 2017, Boris Johnson, then Britain’s foreign minister, declared that “one of the first things we will do with the two new `colossal`<sup>巨大的</sup> aircraft-carriers that we have just built is send them on a freedom of navigation operation to this area.” 

That suggestion was quickly rowed back by officials; sending a large carrier to contest Chinese claims on the South China Sea would be dim when a smaller ship would do as well. But Mr Johnson’s boast showed the carrier’s continuing role as an embodiment of national prestige on top of its duties as an instrument of war. General Houghton, the former British defence chief, concedes that the Queen Elizabeth and Prince of Wales may be “too totemic to Britain’s sense of place in the world” to be given up. Though Japanese officials say they need carriers to defend their outlying islands, Alessio Patalano, an expert on Japan’s naval forces, says that “alliance integration”—being able to swap planes with American carriers—and “greater status” may matter more. When France dispatched the Charles de Gaulle to bomb IS in Syria in 2015, President François Hollande proclaimed it “an instrument of force and power, the symbol of our independence”. 

Last June, at an annual gathering of military `bigwigs`<sup>权贵之人</sup> in Singapore, France’s defence minister joshed her British counterpart by pointing out that the previous year both had vied to send more frigates to the Shangri-La Dialogue than the other. “So today,” she boasted, “I upped my game and came with a full carrier strike group.” As befits the French navy’s flagship, the Charles de Gaulle houses not just IS-bombing Rafales but also four bars and a boulangerie capable of producing over 1,000 baguettes a day. At a cocktail party on the carrier a beautifully baked bread model of the ship was on display; a symbol of national identity, inside a symbol of national power.

<h3 id="2.2">The future of entertainment</h3>

IN HOLLYWOOD LINGO, Disney+ launched hot. On blitz day, as Disney called the eve of its television-streaming service’s debut on November 12th, a massive marketing campaign reached a `climax`<sup>高潮</sup>. Buses in its theme parks were wrapped in ads, employees in Disney shops wore QR codes for people to sign up with smartphones and ABC’s “Dancing with the Stars” trailed the excitement to come. By the end of the first day, 10m people had signed up—beyond Disney’s highest expectations, it said. Its servers struggled to cope. The company rushed to fix the [`glitches`](  "A glitch is a problem that stops something from working properly or being successful. 故障"), as viewers devoured “The Mandalorian”, a specially made live-action “Star Wars” spin-off. 

For $6.99 a month—slightly less than the cost of a cinema ticket—viewers in America, Canada and the Netherlands can now tap the world’s most valuable entertainment catalogue. As well as new original content, they can watch anything from “Snow White” to “Avengers: Endgame” and, thanks to Disney’s $71bn acquisition this year of 21st Century Fox, all 662 episodes of “The Simpsons” (America’s favourite cartoon family was also enlisted in the ad blitz). Behind the scenes, a new recommendation algorithm `hoovered up`<sup>吸收</sup> enough user data in a few hours to start sending millions of personalised viewing suggestions, says Kevin Mayer, who runs Disney’s international and direct-to-consumer businesses, including Disney+. 

Going into on-demand streaming is an `epochal`<sup>划时代的</sup> shift for the 96-year-old company. Like its Hollywood rivals, it has built an empire on controlling access to films and TV shows, which were released in dribs and drabs—on cinema screens, broadcast networks and cable channels. That model, the entertainment industry has concluded, is no longer viable in the internet age. In October AT&T, which owns WarnerMedia, the former Time Warner, unveiled HBO Max. The new service will give viewers full online access to HBO programming, as well as to other valuable content including the libraries of Warner Bros, New Line Cinema and Japan’s Studio Ghibli, plus new original shows. NBCUniversal will parry with Peacock, a mainly ad-supported streaming platform also expected next year. Smaller services such as CBS All Access and Showtime have already piled in. On November 1st Apple, a tech giant with entertainment aspirations, launched Apple TV+, its own streaming service with several star-studded original shows. 

“We are surprised it took them all so long,” `quips`<sup>嘲讽</sup> Ted Sarandos, chief content officer of Netflix, which began the streaming revolution in 2007. But now they are here. It is, in the words of Brian Roberts, chief executive of Comcast, a cable [`behemoth`](    "If you refer to something as a behemoth, you mean that it is extremely large, and often that it is unpleasant, inefficient, or difficult to manage. 庞然大物; 难以驾驭的事物") which owns NBCUniversal, “an important moment, as many parties across broad industries have entered the competition for content creation”. 

That competition should benefit consumers, who can expect a [`surfeit`](    "A surfeit of something is an amount which is too large. 过量") of high-quality fare. For media companies and their shareholders, it will be brutal. Billions of dollars will get torched. Some endings will be happier than others. 

The entertainment business’s original script was simple. People paid for cinema tickets (and later video rentals) to watch films, and advertisers paid networks for access to viewers of their TV shows. That began to change in the 1990s. Hit series like “The Sopranos” and “Sex and the City” on HBO, a cable channel then owned by Time Warner, proved that people would pay extra for compelling television. But HBO still relied on “sequential” releases of weekly episodes. It was also a wholesale proposition, sold in a bundle of pay-TV channels. “The big bang”, says Barry Diller, chairman of IAC, who in 1986 founded Fox Broadcasting as a rival to the three incumbent free-to-air networks, ABC, CBS and NBC, came in the mid-2000s with Netflix and, soon after, Amazon Prime Video, the e-commerce giant’s streaming service. 

The industry’s initial response to the challengers was to pawn its crown jewels. Netflix paid hundreds of millions of dollars for rights to stream beloved sitcoms like “Friends” or “The Office”. HBO struck deals with Amazon to supply it with programming such as “Six Feet Under”. This allowed the streaming upstarts to rack up subscribers and splurge on more content. In time, they began producing their own programmes, notably in 2013 with “House of Cards”. Netflix released the entire first season of its political drama at once, `ushering`<sup>引领</sup> in the age of `“binge-watching”`<sup>一口气看完</sup>. 

Meanwhile, the rest of the business was being reshaped in other ways. Many media groups were folded into vertically integrated conglomerates that controlled both the production and distribution of content. In 2013 Comcast completed its purchase of NBCUniversal. In 2015 AT&T, a telecoms company, bought DirecTV, a satellite firm, and in 2018 paid $85bn for Time Warner, owner of HBO and the Warner Bros studio. Disney eschewed vertical integration but expanded horizontally. Its megadeal with 21st Century Fox was the fourth for its boss, Bob Iger, who had earlier snapped up Pixar (an animation studio), Lucasfilm (maker of “Star Wars”), and Marvel Entertainment, home of Marvel Comics. 

This flurry of consolidation created a handful of giant content owners, with massive back catalogues and a willingness to spend heavily on old shows and new programming (see chart 1). In October HBO Max reportedly agreed to pay over $500m for the American rights to air 23 old series and three new ones of “South Park”, a satirical cartoon owned by Viacom. It was one of the biggest on-demand-licensing deals of all time. The same rights went for $192m four years ago. As one media executive puts it, with more than a hint of admiration, “AT&T is not screwing around.” Since 2010 just three groups—WarnerMedia, Disney and Netflix—have ploughed a total of $250bn into programming (see chart 2). 

As content-related costs have surged, the [`lucrative`](    "A lucrative activity, job, or business deal is very profitable. 获利丰厚的") old business model has `receded`<sup>减弱</sup>. Netflix has made viewers less willing to pay over the odds for a big bundle of pay-TV channels, which generated margins of around 50% and accounted for as much as three-quarters of profits at media conglomerates like Time Warner, Disney, Viacom or News Corporation. Streaming as a stand-alone business either loses money or at best, breaks even. Netflix books accounting profits but has yet to turn free cashflow positive (though it expects to soon). It has accumulated $12bn of long-term debt despite making no acquisitions. Media firms moving into streaming have “swapped a quarter for a nickel and paid $5 for the privilege,” sums up one executive. 

There are three ways to make streaming pay. Firms can accumulate deep ranks of loyal subscribers at home and abroad. They can raise prices. Or they can spend less on programming. 

Winning over millions of subscribers is getting harder. Once consumers have paid for broadband and for a simple bundle of news and sports, it takes only three or four streaming services at current prices before the bill adds up to not much less than what they coughed up for old pay-TV. Companies are jumping into streaming in a peak-attention economy, notes Tim Mulligan of MIDiA Research. Consumers have no more spare leisure time for new TV apps. Reed Hastings, boss of Netflix, has named “Fortnite”, a hit video game, and sleep as his main competition. 

In practice, his and others’ streaming services will probably have to claw viewers away from each other. Even then, customers may not stay. Switching costs are low. People might sign up for Disney+ to see “The Mandalorian”, leave and then come back a year later for a new Marvel film. 

If building an enormous subscriber base looks hard, what about raising prices? Netflix did so in the spring, when its standard plan went up by $2. There is chatter that Disney may need to raise its price for Disney+ sooner rather than later. But that risks driving subscribers into rivals’ arms. 

Again, Netflix serves as a cautionary tale. In the third quarter it added just 500,000 American subscribers, 300,000 fewer than expected. Earlier this year it saw their number decline for the first time in 12 years. And that was before Disney, Apple and others entered the fray. Globally, Netflix now expects to add 26.7m subscribers this year, down from 28.6m in 2018; 90% of its subscriber growth comes from abroad, where it is potentially more expensive to win viewers because of the need to tailor content for each market. 

That leaves spending on programming as the last `lever`<sup>杠杆</sup> on profits. This, says Mr Roberts of Comcast, will need to be pulled back somewhat over time. There is no sign of that yet. According to Bloomberg Intelligence, a research firm, the average cost of producing a single episode of a scripted drama is close to $6m, twice the going rate of three to four years ago. This year 16 firms, from Disney to Quibi, a short-form mobile-video platform, will spend a total of $100bn on content, according to UBS, a bank. That is roughly equal to the sum invested in America’s oil industry this year. 

Disney expects its streaming service to break even by 2024, once it reaches 60m-90m subscribers. The plan is for two-thirds of these to come from overseas. Some on Wall Street worry that the firm could lose money on Disney+ for years to come. Streaming may encourage a faster rate of `“cord-cutting”`<sup>掐线</sup>, as people cancel pricey pay-TV subscriptions, cannibalising the company’s mainstay cable profits. 

Mr Iger has as good as admitted that Disney is betting the farm. But, as he explained in his recently published autobiography, it has little choice. Its rivals appear to share the sentiment. AT&T expects to invest $2bn in year one of HBO Max and to earn no revenue at the start. Over time, the hope is, investment will go down and revenue will rise; the service is also expected to break even in five years. 

Still, a shake-out looks inevitable. There is much uncertainty about who will be left standing. The prevailing view in the industry is that Netflix will be hard to dislodge. It has amassed 158m global subscribers and created a brand that appeals to all ages and tastes. Its recent purchase of rights to “Seinfeld” will help make up for the loss of “Friends” and “The Office”, two of its most popular shows which AT&T and Comcast, respectively, plan to pull from Netflix. It has 47,000 TV episodes and 4,000 films in its American catalogue, according to Ampere Analysis, a research firm. That is far more than the 7,500 episodes and 500 films that Disney+ will offer in its first year. It will spend $15bn or so this year on original content. Mr Sarandos says there are no plans to adjust Netflix’s strategy in response to all the new competition. 

Disney, with its must-see shows and profits that are the envy of the industry, is also here to stay. So in all likelihood is HBO Max, which can tap its parent company’s 170m customer relationships. “We could not do this without AT&T,” says Bob Greenblatt, chairman of WarnerMedia Entertainment, who oversees the group’s direct-to-consumer business. “There is no way that we could so easily reach tens of millions of people on our own.” As with Comcast, whose Peacock service should find a nest in the new media landscape, entertainment is becoming an important source of revenue for AT&T. The phone giant will also use HBO Max to acquire and retain wireless customers. Smaller content players such as Discovery and Sony Entertainment will have to identify niches. CBS and Viacom (which are merging) are planning an arms-dealer strategy—of supplying content to anyone who wants to buy it. 

Over time, firms that can aggregate the various streaming services in bundles with simple interfaces will [`reap`]( "If you reap the benefits or the rewards of something, you enjoy the good things that happen as a result of it. 获得") rewards. Consumers are overwhelmed by the volume of content coming their way. They are increasingly fed up with having to search for shows on various platforms. Internet service providers such as Comcast and Verizon can help curate this video onslaught. Comcast’s Xfinity Flex, a new service for broadband-only customers, for example, offers a seamless way to use more than 100 video and music services. A voice-controlled TV remote can search for, say, “the episode in ‘Seinfeld’ where George claims to be a marine biologist”. 

Then there are the technology giants. For them, producing entertainment is not an end in itself, says Matthew Ball, former head of strategy at Amazon Studios (and an occasional contributor to The Economist). In Amazon’s case, TV is a way to retain Prime subscribers and sell more shoes and loo roll. For Apple it is about selling hardware and expanding its range of services. 

Many media executives, particularly the `veterans`<sup>老兵</sup> among them, worry about what this means for the future of high-quality content. In their view, much of the film and TV business is now run by clueless outsiders. They cite Apple’s “Stories to Believe in”, as its first TV shows were mawkishly trailed, as evidence of naivety. “The Morning Show”, a drama about working in television starring Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon, got mixed reviews. “The show, and the service, don’t need to exist,” concluded Rolling Stone magazine. Despite kudos for backing critically acclaimed shows like “Fleabag” and “The Marvelous Mrs Maisel”, Amazon’s longer record in TV draws similarly tepid reviews. “Apple doesn’t know what the fuck they are doing and Amazon knows less,” concludes a former film-studio bigwig. 

Top management at AT&T wants HBO to produce a lot more programming. In practice, that could include less rarefied fare that might appeal to America’s heartland, not just its coastal elites. HBO’s unabashedly elitist old-timers are not keen on the new strategy. The decision by John Stankey, head of the telecom firm’s entertainment unit, to ramp up production prompted a raft of departures, including that of Richard Plepler, HBO’S head, who gave the green light to “Game of Thrones”. “Stankey wants HBO to compete with Netflix,” says Rick Rosen, a founder of the Endeavour Agency. But many people worry that there is a big risk of HBO’s brand losing its distinctiveness. “After 20 more years of doing it,” jokes one streaming boss, “John Stankey will be a great creative executive.” 

It would nevertheless be a mistake to conclude that outsiders will never get things right. Jeff Bewkes, former chief executive of Time Warner, once dismissed Netflix as “the Albanian Army”. Now Hollywood considers the company a legitimate film studio. It is also easy to overstate the role of senior executives at media firms’ parent companies. Much of the creativity in Hollywood comes from lower down, from outside big firms and from informal networks of writers and stars, some with their own production companies, including Ms Witherspoon and Michael B. Jordan. 

Tinseltown has a way of absorbing outsiders. Media executives point out that Apple and Amazon are already adapting. At first they put tech types in charge of their TV operations but later installed seasoned film folk with strong links to the creative world. On November 12th it was reported that Mr Plepler is in talks with Apple about an exclusive production agreement. Like many a moneyman seduced over the years, Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s boss, seems star-struck. He goes to all the awards ceremonies, including the Golden Globes—above and beyond what even movie-studio bosses feel obliged to, remarks a former studio executive. 

As long as money keeps flowing, creativity should flourish. So far, shareholders appear happy to let it flow. Netflix’s share price has fallen from its peak in mid-2018 but the company remains highly rated relative to earnings. Disney shares have risen by 28% since the company revealed the details of Disney+ to investors in April. AT&T and Comcast are also up this year. 

Even before the taps are tightened—as they inevitably will be—the streaming wars have reshaped media well beyond video entertainment. The shift from linear schedules to fragmented, on-demand consumption makes it harder for any one company to exert a big influence on people’s viewing, says Bob Bakish, chief executive of Viacom. Every company needs to adapt accordingly, he adds. It is also weakening the link between entertainment and television news. That is most visible in Rupert Murdoch’s decision to sell much of 21st Century Fox to Disney, a deal which closed in March. He continues to control News Corp, containing newspapers, and Fox Corporation, a broadcaster that owns Fox News and other assets. 

The wild card hanging over the industry is what the tech giants will do next. Some people think Apple could cut its spending on entertainment or even exit the business. It is seen as more unpredictable than Amazon, which seems committed to making and showing content. Yet the overriding view in Hollywood is that, with their untold piles of cash and their valuations of $1trn or so apiece, the tech giants are only just getting started. They could easily swallow a media firm or two. 

Trustbusters may [`stymie`](    "If you are stymied by something, you find it very difficult to take action or to continue what you are doing. 妨碍") any such move by Alphabet, Google’s parent, which already owns YouTube. Amazon might find it hard in practice given scrutiny of its rapid expansion (and Jeff Bezos’s ownership of the Washington Post). Apple might have an easier time. When Mr Bewkes was looking to sell Time Warner a few years ago, talks were held with Apple as well as AT&T. There has been much chatter about Mr Iger’s comment in his autobiography that, if Steve Jobs were still alive, Disney and Apple would have combined (Disney, for its part, nearly bought Twitter in 2016). 

For all Mr Sarandos’s fighting talk, even Netflix could be a target if the streaming wars affect its growth and the firm’s finances come under pressure. As dizzying as the pace of change has been in media in the past few years, it is unlikely to [`let up`](   "If an unpleasant, continuous process lets up, it stops or becomes less intense. 停止; 减弱").

<h3 id="3.1">Giant 3D printers for making boats, bridges, buildings and rockets</h3>

BOAT BUILDING is a [`long-winded`]( "If you describe something that is written or said as long-winded, you are critical of it because it is longer than necessary. 冗长的; 啰嗦的")<sup>冗长的</sup> and [`tedious`](   "If you describe something such as a job, task, or situation as tedious, you mean it is boring and frustrating. 乏味烦人的")<sup>沉闷的</sup> business, even when what is going down the slipway is a small craft made from modern materials such as fibreglass, rather than something nailed together out of planks of wood. Construct a mould. Build up layers of resin and glass fibre inside that mould. Extract the completed structure and finish it. All told, it can take months. That, though, may soon change. For researchers at the University of Maine are now in the process of testing an 8-metre (25-foot) patrol boat that took just 72 hours to make from scratch (see picture [`overleaf`](  "Overleaf is used in books and magazines to say that something is on the other side of the page you are reading. 在背面")<sup>在背面</sup>). Their trick was to build the [`vessel`](   "A vessel is a ship or large boat. 船; 舰") using a giant 3D printer. 

Since they appeared in commercial form in the 1990s, 3D printers have generally been employed in factories to make small things like prototype models, components of jet-engines and dental crowns. Now, a new generation of outsize printers is arriving. These are capable of turning out much bigger objects than previously possible, and printing them faster. 

To print the patrol boat, part of an American army project, the team in Maine linked up with Oak Ridge National Laboratory, in Tennessee, which helped develop the printing process, and Ingersoll Machine Tools, in Illinois, which built the printer itself. The university reckons that for boat building, a common trade in the state, large 3D printers of this sort will dramatically cut the cost and time required to produce new vessels. 

Broadly speaking, the biggest object that can be turned out by a 3D printer is determined by the size of the printer itself—and most printers are not much larger than a large domestic refrigerator. Over the years engineers have come up with various ways of scaling this up a bit, by doing things like mounting the printing mechanism on a piece of external [`scaffolding`](    "Scaffolding consists of poles and boards made into a temporary framework that is used by workers when they are painting, repairing, or building high parts of a building, usually outside. 脚手架"). But the result is often a slow and inaccurate device that turns out things which require a lot of expensive hand-finishing. 

The University of Maine’s printer overcomes the problem of scale by suspending the printer’s business end—the [`nozzle`](   "The nozzle of a hose or pipe is a narrow piece attached to the end to control the flow of liquid or gas. 喷嘴")<sup>喷嘴</sup> that extrudes the ink—from a gantry. The ink is molten `thermoplastic`<sup>热塑性的</sup> `resin`<sup>树脂</sup> containing carbon fibres. Under the control of a computer the nozzle moves horizontally to build (as is true of any 3D-printing process) the desired object up layer by layer. After each layer is complete, the nozzle is raised slightly to deposit another on top of it until the object is finished. 

And this can be done quickly. The Maine university printer is able to extrude material at a rate of 70kg (150lbs) an hour. At the moment it can make things up to 30 metres long, 7 metres wide and 3 metres high, but those dimensions could easily be increased by building a bigger gantry. The arm carrying the nozzle can also be fitted with processing equipment, such as an automated milling head to grind off any surface imperfections. 

Having established the principle, the university is now looking to change the nature of the composite, to make the process more environmentally friendly. New England’s forestry industry is a potential source of `cellulose`<sup>纤维素</sup> fibres that could be incorporated into the ink instead of carbon fibres. That would please Greens, because carbon fibres are usually made from oil-based materials. Habib Dagher, one of the project’s leaders, says the aim is to print with a material containing 50% wood products. This would create a composite as strong and light as aluminium. And with further work the group hope to deposit that material at 230kg an hour. The researchers recently used cellulose fibres and a resin made from maize to print a mould for constructing the roof of a boat. To add to the greenery, this mould could be recycled and the material used again. 

Making moulds and production tools will be an important job for large-format 3D printing, says Craig Blue, director of energy efficiency at Oak Ridge. Tool-making is expensive for two reasons. It requires specialist skills. And the items produced tend to be one-offs or to be made in small numbers, so there are no economies of scale. For 3D printers, however, the cost of making one or many items is about the same. 

There are other advantages. For example, an Oak Ridge system was used by contractors to print specially shaped moulds for concrete castings on the façade of a 45-storey building on the site of an old sugar refinery in Brooklyn, New York. Usually, such moulds are made out of wood by skilled `carpenters`<sup>木匠</sup> and might last only three or four pourings, so builders get through a lot of them. But, Dr Blue says, the 3D-printed versions, composed of carbon-fibre-reinforced plastic, were able to survive at least 200 pourings. 

Oak Ridge is also working on ways to print concrete structures directly. The practicalities of erecting massive 3D-printing gantries suggest printing `skyscrapers`<sup>摩天楼</sup> and other large structures is probably best not done in one go, but in smaller sections. Printing precast concrete subunits in the controlled conditions of a factory and then assembling them on site can be better suited to making complex and artistic structures. This is the approach taken by Xu Weiguo and his colleagues at Tsinghua University in Beijing. They used a pair of robotic arms that extrude concrete mixed with `polyethylene`<sup>聚乙烯</sup> fibres to print precast sections which were then assembled into a 26-metre footbridge that spans a pond in an industrial park in Shanghai. 

This structure is styled after the Anji Bridge, a stone arch built around 600AD across the Xiaohe river in Hebei province. The [`replica`]( "A replica of something such as a statue, building, or weapon is an accurate copy of it. (雕像、建筑物或武器等的) 复制品")<sup>复制品</sup> took 450 hours to print—leisurely by the standards of Maine’s boatyard, but rapid compared both with the ten years the original took and the pace at which even modern building sites tend to move. The researchers reckon production costs were two-thirds that of making a similar bridge from conventionally cast concrete sections. 

Other forms of 3D printing are getting bigger and faster, too. Chad Mirkin and his colleagues at Northwestern University, Illinois, have come up with something they call high-area rapid printing (HARP). Their prototype can make things four metres tall, with a cross section of nearly a square metre. It does so by pulling these solid objects out of a shallow pool of liquid `polymer`<sup>聚合物</sup>. 

The printer scales up an existing industrial process which starts with the liquid polymer being held in a container with a transparent base. An `ultraviolet`<sup>紫外的</sup> image of the layers to be built is projected through the base. This triggers a chemical reaction which cures a corresponding layer of polymer immediately above the base, so that it solidifies into the image of the projected light. The first layer attaches itself to a tool lowered into the liquid from above. As the tool is raised it lifts the object out of the pool to permit subsequent layers to be added from below. 

The innovation which HARP brings is having a film of oil flow across the transparent base. This oil, the researchers say, behaves like “liquid Teflon”. It stops the polymer layers sticking to the base and also removes heat generated during curing. The result is that the printer can run much faster than was previously possible. It can, says Dr Mirkin, print in a couple of hours an object the size of an adult human being. A conventional 3D printer using this method would require a couple of days. 

The HARP process allows a wide range of materials to be printed at large scale, including hundreds of different polymers, each one of which could be hard, soft or rubbery. It can also print resins that contain materials like silicon carbide, which can be processed into hard-wearing heat-resistant ceramics. Components made from all these materials might be used in products ranging from cars to aircraft to buildings. The system can also be scaled up further, adds Dr Mirkin. He has co-founded a company, Azul 3D, to commercialise the process and expects the first HARP printer to be on the market in about 18 months. 

The most difficult task 3D printing faces, though, is printing large metal objects. The main way of printing in metal is to melt successive layers of a metallic powder using a laser or an electron beam. To stop the powder oxidising and being `contaminated`<sup>污染</sup> by impurities in the air—or worse, exploding—that process needs to be carried out in a chamber filled with an inert gas. Scaling this procedure up is tricky and would be exceedingly expensive. 

Yet metal printing is also escaping the box. One way it is doing so is by the deployment of large robots brandishing various types of MIG welders. “MIG” stands for metal-inert gas. MIG welders work by feeding a sacrificial electrode made of wire through the nozzle of a welding torch. The wire is connected at one end to a supply of electricity and at the other to an earthed workpiece. When the torch is held close to the workpiece an electric arc forms between its surface and the wire. The heat from the arc causes the wire and adjacent metal to melt and fuse together. During the process the torch blows an inert gas, such as argon, over the weld to protect it. 

To turn a welding torch into a 3D printer the robot welds continuously over the same area, building up layer after layer of metal. This process is used by MX3D, a Dutch 3D-printing company, to build a variety of metal objects. Appropriately for the Netherlands, these include a lightweight bicycle printed in aluminium and a 12-metre long stainless-steel pedestrian bridge to cross a canal in Amsterdam. 

Relativity Space, a firm in Los Angeles, is using large continuous-welding robots to build parts for space rockets (see picture at top of article). Each robot has an aluminium-alloy wire fed along its arm to the print head at its tip. The print head uses a high-temperature plasma arc to melt the wire and deposit it in layers `whilst`<sup>同时</sup> blowing an inert shielding gas around the arc. 

3D-printed rockets, Relativity Space says, can be made faster and with fewer parts than conventional ones. The company has big ambitions. Its first rockets will be used to launch satellites but it hopes eventually to use its production system, which it calls Stargate, to print a rocket on the surface of Mars. When it comes to wondering what 3D printing is capable of, it seems, even the sky is not the limit.

<h3 id="3.2">How to forge rhinoceros horn </h3>

RHINOCEROS HORNS are big business. Traditional Chinese medicine uses them to treat `rheumatism`<sup>风湿病</sup> and `gout`<sup>痛风</sup>, even though they have no actual pharmaceutical properties beyond placebo. And Yemeni craftsmen carve them into dagger handles. A kilogram can thus command as much as $60,000, so there is tremendous incentive for poachers to hunt the animals. Since almost all rhinoceros populations are endangered, several critically, this is a serious problem. Some conservationists therefore suggest that a way to reduce pressure on the animals might be to flood the market with fakes. This, they hope, would reduce the value of real horns and consequently the incentive to hunt rhinos. 

That would require the fakes to be good. But Fritz Vollrath, a zoologist at Oxford University, reckons his skills as a forger are up to the challenge. As he writes in Scientific Reports, he and his colleagues from Fudan University, in Shanghai, have come up with a cheap and easy-to-make knock-off that is strikingly similar to the real thing. 

The main `ingredient`<sup>原料</sup> of Dr Vollrath’s forged horns is horsehair. Despite their differing appearances, horses and rhinos are reasonably closely related. Horses do not have horns, of course. But, technically, neither do rhinos. Unlike the structures that adorn cattle and bison, which have cores made of bone, the “horns” of rhinoceros are composed of hairs bound tightly together by a mixture of dead cells. 

Examination under a microscope showed that hairs collected from horses’ tails had similar dimensions and symmetry to those found in the horns of rhinos. They also shared a spongy core structure. Horse hairs had a scaly layer that was absent from those of the rhino, but the researchers were able to strip this away with a solution of lithium bromide. 

The next task they tackled was making a suitable binding matrix. This, Dr Vollrath and his coauthor Mi Ruixin made from a fibrous protein-rich glue of the sort produced naturally by spiders and silkworms. They bundled the treated horse hairs as tightly as they could in a matrix of this glue, and then left the bundles in an oven to dry. 

The result was a material that, with some polishing, looked like rhino horn. Specimens on the black market are, however, inspected carefully before sale, so for the false horns to be effective they would need to stand up to closer [`scrutiny`](    "If a person or thing is under scrutiny, they are being studied or observed very carefully. 仔细研究; 仔细观察")<sup>仔细观察</sup> than the naked eye. To this end, Dr Vollrath and Dr Mi decided to test their product in detail. 

DNA analysis would certainly reveal fakes, but such analysis is complicated and therefore hard to do in the sorts of back rooms in which rhino-horn sales tend to take place. The forgeries passed other tests with flying colours, though. 

First, fake and real horn looked the same when examined under a scanning electron microscope. Next, they behaved similarly when tested by a technique that compared their capacity to absorb heat. Finally, when stressed or strained and then relaxed regularly for long periods, to probe their underlying mechanical properties, the results for real and false horn were indistinguishable. 

Whether using [`clandestine`](  "Something that is clandestine is hidden or kept secret, often because it is illegal. (常指非法地) 暗中的; 秘密的")<sup>秘密的</sup> means to launch impeccable fakes onto the rhinoceros-horn market would truly reduce prices and sabotage demand remains to be tested. But it might. It is an old trick in warfare to flood the enemy with forged, worthless money. Something similar may yet help save the rhino.

<h3 id="3.3">Sensors, data and the self-policing rugby match</h3>

RUGBY UNION, it is often said, is a game for `thugs`<sup>暴徒</sup> that is played by gentlemen. “Played by lawyers” might be a more accurate dictum. The rules are famously complicated. Scrums—organised shoving matches between the two teams’ `burliest`<sup>粗壮</sup> members—are regarded as a dark art even by other players. Open, running play can be stopped and wound back for any number of [`arcane`](    "Something that is arcane is secret or mysterious. 秘密的; 神秘的") infringements. The recent Rugby World Cup competition, held in Japan, is regarded as a big success by those keen to boost the sport’s popularity. But it was [`marred`](    "To mar something means to spoil or damage it. 破坏") by arguments about how to interpret complicated new rules forbidding dangerous shoulder charges and high tackles. (World Rugby, the game’s governing body, offers referees a handy flowchart to memorise, which provides for eight possible outcomes.) 

All this is an irritant to players and referees, and a turn-off for viewers, who struggle to follow the action or work out why a particular decision was made. But a British firm called Sportable thinks it might be able to improve things, by wiring up rugby players—and rugby balls—with high-tech sensors. 

Sportable was founded in 2014 by Dugald Macdonald and Peter Husemeyer, a pair of rugby-mad South Africans. It makes lightweight, sensor-stuffed garments that can be worn under a jersey and which measure impact forces in 80 separate places on a player’s body. The sensors are attached to transmitters that communicate with receivers at the edges of the playing field. By monitoring the time it takes for signals to arrive at different receivers, and applying a little mathematics, it is possible to work out where a player is on the pitch at any given moment, and how quickly he got there. 

Such data, says Mr Macdonald, are attractive to teams looking for an edge over the competition. Previous efforts have relied on the Global Positioning System of satellites, which offers much lower accuracy. The firm has tested its technology with several professional clubs, including Saracens, the reigning champions in the English Premiership. 

Where the fun starts, though, is when similar sensors are put into the ball. It can then, metaphorically, squawk if passed forward (which is illegal in rugby), and there will be no doubt, by comparing the positions of ball and player, when a player is offside. A smart ball will be able to monitor other rules, too. It was, for instance, tested successfully in a five-a-side version of the game called Rugby X, in which you are not allowed to kick the ball higher than ten metres. Since few referees are equipped with theodolites, enforcing this rule has been hard. Now it is easy.

Disney’s streaming video service went live, the latest in a lengthening line of challengers to Netflix’s dominance of the market. The `trove`<sup>收藏的东西</sup> of programming on Disney+ not only includes its archive of animated classics, but also catalogues of material from other studios that Disney owns, which include Marvel, Pixar and 20th Century Fox. Along with rivals like Amazon and Apple (but not Netflix) Disney wants to [`entice`](   "To entice someone to go somewhere or to do something means to try to persuade them to go to that place or to do that thing. 怂恿") customers into its wider product range—in its case, theme parks and cruises. See article. 

Donald Trump increased the pressure on China to agree to a “phase one” trade deal, threatening to raise tariffs “substantially” if it does not. Whether America removes all tariffs or just those that are scheduled to come into effect in December remains a sticking-point in the negotiations. Diplomats are also searching for a neutral [`venue`](    "The venue for an event or activity is the place where it will happen. 举办场所") where the two countries’ presidents can sign a deal in front of the world’s cameras, after Chile cancelled the APEC summit in Santiago where the ceremony was supposed to take place. 

GDP in both Germany and Japan grew by just 0.1% in the third quarter compared with the previous three months. Germany avoided a recession (its economy shrank by 0.2% in the second quarter), helped in part by a welcome rise in the country’s exports, which have struggled during global trade tensions. Britain also dodged a recession, chalking up growth of 0.3% following a previous contraction. Solid performances in the construction and services sectors offset flat growth in agriculture and manufacturing. See article. 

Alibaba was reported to have secured approval from the Hong Kong stock exchange to sell shares in a secondary listing. The Chinese e-commerce giant listed on the New York bourse five years ago. It had been expected to float shares in Hong Kong earlier this year, before the outbreak of huge street protests; the threat of escalating unrest to the financial hub still remains. See article. 

The prospectus for Saudi Aramco’s IPO provided few details for investors, such as an indicative share price or an exact date for its stockmarket debut on the Riyadh exchange. Those particulars are expected to be announced soon. The prospectus did indicate that 1bn shares in the state-owned oil company will be offered to Saudi Arabia’s small investors. 

The California Trucking Association launched a legal challenge against the state’s new law giving wage and benefit protections to independent contractors. The rules are aimed at workers in the gig economy, though they will also apply to caretakers, maids, carers and many others. The truckers’ group says its drivers’ ability to set their own timetables will be hampered and interstate commerce undermined. Uber and others want a measure to be put before voters next year that would `exempt`<sup>免除</sup> them from the law, which comes into effect on January 1st. 

A deal that will see Ascension, an American hospital network, share patient data with Google attracted the `ire`<sup>愤怒</sup> of lawmakers worried about privacy. Suspicion about Google’s intentions in health is a running theme: it was also criticised for a collaboration with a British hospital in 2016, and with the University of Chicago a year later. It was also reported that Google wants to move into banking, which could set up a clash with financial regulators. 

In an update on the progress it is making towards regulatory approval to fly the 737 MAX aircraft, which has been grounded for most of the year following two crashes, Boeing said it was “possible” that deliveries to airlines could resume in December and that it hopes soon to secure consent for new pilot-training requirements. Southwest and American Airlines pushed back the dates for when they expect the 737 MAX can take off again until early March. 

British Steel, which has been in `liquidation`<sup>清算</sup> following a Brexit-induced slump in orders, received a takeover offer from Jingye, a Chinese steelmaker. There is some uncertainty about Jingye’s long-term commitment. BS specialises in railway tracks and construction girders, technology that Jingye lacks back home. 

Carl Icahn, an activist investor, revealed that he has built a 4.2% stake in HP and will push it to accept a takeover offer from Xerox. 

Tesla chose Berlin as the site for its first factory in Europe, making electric cars and batteries. “Berlin rocks,” raved Elon Musk, Tesla’s boss. Production should start in 2021. 

American [`connoisseurs`](  "A connoisseur is someone who knows a lot about the arts, food, drink, or some other subject. 鉴赏家; 行家") of craft brew were crying in their ale upon the news that Anheuser-Busch InBev has struck a deal to buy Redhook, a pioneer in the small-brewers revolution that began 40 years ago. The global beer conglomerate decided now was the time to swallow the roughly 70% it does not already own of Craft Brew Alliance, which also owns Kona and other brands, after its share price fell flat.

Unrest flared again in Hong Kong after a protester died. Another was shot at close range by a police officer, allegedly while trying to grab his gun. A man was set on fire by demonstrators after remonstrating with them. One senior officer said society was on the “brink of a total breakdown”. The Chinese government said Hong Kong was “sliding into the `abyss`<sup>深渊</sup> of terrorism”. See article. 

China’s president, Xi Jinping, paid a visit to Greece, an important partner in the Chinese Belt and Road Initiative, which aims to improve global infrastructure. The two countries said they would work to “overcome any obstacles” facing a Chinese state-owned company’s plan to upgrade the port of Piraeus. Mr Xi promised support for Greece’s campaign to secure the return of the Elgin marbles from Britain. 

India’s Supreme Court awarded the site of a mosque in the city of Ayodhya that was `demolished`<sup>拆毁</sup> by Hindu [`zealots`](    "If you describe someone as a zealot, you think that their views and actions are very extreme, especially in following a particular political or religious belief. (尤指政治或宗教的)狂热分子; 极端分子") in 1992 to Hindus planning to build a temple to the god Rama. It also criticised the destruction. The government was ordered to provide land nearby for the construction of a new mosque. The decision prompted grumbles from disappointed Muslims, but not the violence many had feared. See article. 

Gambia lodged a complaint against Myanmar at the International Court of Justice on behalf of the OIC, a group of predominantly Muslim countries. They accuse Myanmar of violating the UN convention on genocide in its treatment of Rohingya Muslims. 

Cambodia’s prime minister, Hun Sen, said he would release 70 opposition activists arrested in recent weeks. Under pressure from international donors the government had earlier released Kem Sokha, a prominent opposition leader, from house arrest. See article. 

Evo Morales quit as Bolivia’s president after nearly 14 years in office. The chief of the armed forces had suggested he leave following widespread protests, which broke out after Mr Morales’s victory in a dubious election on October 20th. Mr Morales accepted Mexico’s offer of political asylum. Jeanine Áñez, a political foe of Mr Morales, took office as Bolivia’s interim president. She has said she will hold fresh elections. See article. 

Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Brazil’s president from 2003 to 2010, was freed from prison, where he was serving a sentence for corruption, after the country’s highest court decided that people convicted of crimes could not be jailed until they had used up all their appeals. Upon his release Lula attacked the right-wing government of Jair Bolsonaro. 

Chile’s president, Sebastián Piñera, agreed to begin the process of writing a new constitution. But protesters who are demanding reforms rejected his offer. They want an assembly of citizens, rather than congress, to draft the new document. 

Israel killed a senior commander of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad group in Gaza, setting off a wave of violence. Palestinian militants fired more than 150 rockets into Israel, which responded with air strikes. The fighting may increase the likelihood that the two main political parties in Israel will form a unity government, breaking two months of political deadlock. See article. 

Hassan Rouhani, Iran’s president, claimed that a new oilfield containing 53bn barrels of crude had been discovered. If true, this would increase Iran’s proven reserves, already one of the world’s largest, by about a third. Iran has struggled to export oil since sanctions were reimposed by America last year. 

The central bank of Zimbabwe began reissuing Zimbabwean dollars after a decade-long [`hiatus`]( "A hiatus is a pause in which nothing happens, or a gap where something is missing. 间歇; 空隙"). The new notes are in effect the country’s third currency in the past three years. The government has tried to stay a step ahead of a shortage of cash caused by high inflation and economic mismanagement. 

Spain’s general election, the fourth in four years, gave no party a majority. The Socialists, who had been hoping to move closer to one, actually lost three seats. They swiftly struck a deal with the far-left Podemos party to attempt to form a coalition. Even together, the two parties will need to find support among several regional parties to get over the line. See article. 

Venice was hit by its worst floods for half a century. Water entered St Mark’s Basilica, causing “grave damage”, according to the city’s mayor.

In the British election campaign, Boris Johnson’s Conservative Party got a boost when Nigel Farage, leader of the Brexit Party, said he would not field candidates in the 317 seats the Tories won in 2017. The pressure was on Mr Farage to go further and withdraw from all constituencies where his party threatens to split the Leave vote. See article. 

The first public hearings were held in the inquiry that will determine whether Donald Trump should be impeached for asking the Ukrainian government to dig up political dirt on Joe Biden. The first witnesses in the Democratic-led process were diplomats with responsibility for Ukraine. See article. 

America’s Supreme Court rejected an appeal by Remington, a gunmaker, to block a lawsuit from relatives of the victims in the Sandy Hook school massacre of 2012, in which 20 children and six adults were killed. The lawsuit accuses Remington of illegally marketing combat weapons. 

An appeal by a murderer against his life sentence on the ground that he had already “died” in hospital was rejected by a court in Iowa. Benjamin Schreiber argued that his heart had stopped during an emergency procedure in 2015. But the judges concluded that the convict “is either still alive…or he is actually dead, in which case this appeal is moot”.

<h3 id="5.1">A huge lift business is up for sale</h3>

MODERN CITIES owe their shape to two 19th-century revolutions in personal transportation. For urban sprawl, blame the car. The skyscrapers that shape many of the world’s most recognisable cityscapes would not exist without fast and safe lifts. Whereas the four biggest carmakers sell two-fifths of road vehicles, liftmakers have the market sewn up far more tightly. The top four firms provide over two-thirds of all lifts (see chart). More concentration may be arriving shortly. 

The potential for consolidation comes courtesy of Thyssenkrupp. The struggling German industrial conglomerate needs to raise money as it restructures radically after years of dwindling profits and strategic missteps. Elevator Technology (ET), its lift business, could be worth €15bn-18bn ($17bn-20bn), roughly equivalent to Thyssenkrupp’s market value (including net debt). It plans to sell either a stake in the business or the whole thing. 

There are, it appears, plenty of takers willing to jump on Thyssenkrupp lifts. Groups that submitted bids before a deadline on November 8th are said to include some of the world’s biggest private-equity firms, such as 3G, Blackstone and Carlyle. Finland’s Kone, another lift-industry giant, has long coveted ET. Japan’s Hitachi is also likely to have put in a bid. 

Whoever they turn out to be, the bidders are attracted by an industry that has more ups than downs. The global lift market was worth $73bn in 2018 and the share prices of lift companies have comfortably outperformed the capital-goods industry as a whole for years, according to Morgan Stanley, a bank. Lifts are a “great business”, explains Klas Bergelind of Citi, another bank, because half of all revenues are recurring. The [`cyclical`](    "A cyclical process is one in which a series of events happens again and again in the same order. 周期的") business of selling and installing new lifts is complemented by a steady stream of income from maintaining and modernising existing lifts. 

That part of the business looks poised to gain in importance. Citi expects annual sales of new lifts to grow by around 1% for the next few years. But that still leaves plenty that need maintenance, including the 900,000 or so installed in 2018, double the number a decade earlier. Over 60% of these were built in China, despite its cooling property boom. 

China’s vast servicing market may provide a long-term opportunity that helps the big liftmakers weather the global slowdown in new equipment sales. At the moment maintenance of a worldwide installed base of 16m lifts is a far less concentrated business, largely thanks to a bevy of small Chinese competitors. But as lifts become connected devices, bigger manufacturers could replicate their dominance in the market for new lifts. They have more money than smaller rivals to invest in technologies to diagnose problems remotely in real time, predict failures and prevent breakdowns. 

Which way will ET fall? A sale to a private-equity firm would quickly raise the cash Thyssenkrupp urgently needs. But it would yield none of the economies of scale that a tie-up with another liftmaker could produce. Hitachi, strong in its home market, will see this as its one opportunity to elevate itself into the global big league. And as Jefferies, another bank, observes, Otis and Schindler may not be content to “watch from the sidelines”. 

The firm that has courted ET the longest is Kone. Together the pair would create a firm as towering as the skyscrapers their products make possible. The businesses are geographically complementary: ET is stronger in America, Kone does better in China. Combining their service networks, research and development and the like might save €1bn a year. But overlap in Europe will trouble competition authorities. Thyssenkrupp may prefer a deal with fewer potential regulatory complications. 

Bringing together the world’s two most innovative liftmakers would certainly lift architects’ spirits. ET is testing MULTI, a ropeless system that uses linear motors to allow its lifts to travel up, down and sideways. Kone has developed a carbon-fibre-composite cable that allows ever longer travel heights—and so taller structures. Together these two technologies could reshape the city once again.

<h3 id="5.2">Don’t show, tell</h3>

IT WAS ONE of the [`viral`](    "A viral disease or infection is caused by a virus. 病毒性的") videos of 2017. Robert Kelly, an American academic, was discussing South Korean politics live on BBC World News when his two small children, eager for daddy’s attention, toddled into the room to interrupt him. It was a natural, joyful moment. 

What did not look natural was Mr Kelly’s pose before the interruption. He was being interviewed by video link, staring at his screen, his gaze fixed and glassy. Like most people who use the same technology, he looked as if he was appearing in a hostage video. 

These awkward interactions are a regular feature of 24-hour news channels, with their [`insatiable`](   "If someone has an insatiable desire for something, they want as much of it as they can possibly get. 无法满足的; 贪得无厌的") appetite for experts, many of whom live far from the studio. Increasingly, they are a regular part of people’s working lives, too. Many meetings now require a video screen so that others can participate from afar—their faces looming large like the `villains`<sup>恶棍</sup> appearing on the screen of the bridge of the starship Enterprise in an episode of “Star Trek”. 

The future is likely to involve even more screen-based meetings. One survey, published earlier this year, predicted 12% annual growth in global sales of videoconferencing equipment between now and 2023. 

On the plus side, videoconferencing could contribute to combating climate change. A video link is immeasurably cleaner than a long-haul flight. However, it is difficult to find any realistic estimates of how much this will save in terms of carbon emissions. It is helpful if video calls mean people do not drive to the office; less helpful if they simply avoid public transport. 

Some advocates also claim that videoconferencing beats phone calls. It is, they say, easier to establish a rapport with someone if you see them on screen, rather than simply hear their voice. Facial expressions and hand gestures can give a better clue as to the other person’s mood and intentions, which can help avoid misunderstandings. 

Yet in many professional exchanges you may want to disguise your actual state of mind. Even in more intimate settings than the office texting has replaced phone conversations. If being heard makes many people self-conscious, imagine being seen. Bartleby has a face that only a mother could love—which is why, although he occasionally appears on The Economist’s podcasts, he is rightly absent from its films. He has no desire to be seen by the other people with whom he is communicating—or to see himself in a corner of the screen, a process that automatically makes him want to fidget. If a public-relations type suggests a video interview with someone, your columnist always [`opts`](   "If you opt for something, or opt to do something, you choose it or decide to do it in preference to anything else. 选择") for a phone call instead. 

 

Not everyone wants to be watched while undertaking a long phone call, especially at home where neither clothes nor surroundings `redound to`<sup>有助于</sup> most people’s advantage. It is also hard to pay attention for extended periods. The ability to check emails, or sports scores, is the only way to cope with the tedium of, say, calls to discuss participation in conference panels (which are typically longer than the panel itself). That option disappears when your face is on camera. 

Videoconferencing may improve. Facebook has brought out a product called Portal, which promises (or threatens?) to keep track of you as you move about, always keeping you in shot. Apple plans a feature which will use “advanced image manipulation” to ensure it seems as if your eyes are always looking at the screen, even when they are not. 

To Bartleby, the first recalls scenes in old horror flicks where the eyes in the painting followed the victim around the room. He prefers the sound of the second, especially if a version could keep a digitised version of his face on screen, while artificial intelligence is programmed to insert pre-recorded phrases like “you’re right” and “mmhm” at suitable moments, leaving him to go about his business. 

Great writers have toyed with the idea of our being constantly watched—with disturbing results. Jeremy Bentham [`devised`]( "If you devise a plan, system, or machine, you have the idea for it and design it. 构思; 设计") the `panopticon`<sup>圆形监狱</sup>, a prison where a single guard can see into every inmate’s cell. Winston Smith, the doomed hero of George Orwell’s “1984”, finds that agents of Big Brother have been watching him through his TV screen, and are thus aware of his disloyalty. A videoconference can be highly useful on occasion. But not every meeting requires it. Before switching on the screen, ask yourself: “Is my face really necessary?”

<h3 id="5.3">Ocado wages a grocery war against Amazon, Walmart and Alibaba</h3>

PANIC IS SWEEPING through supermarket [`aisles`](   "An aisle is a long narrow gap that people can walk along between rows of seats in a public building such as a church or between rows of shelves in a supermarket. (座位间或货架间的) 通道"). Profits are [`meagre`](   "If you describe an amount or quantity of something as meagre, you are critical of it because it is very small or not enough. 数量很少的"), convenience is king, discounters are [`rife`](  "If you say that something, usually something bad, is rife in a place or that the place is rife with it, you mean that it is very common. (常指坏事) 普遍的; 猖獗的"). Even Amazon, Walmart and Alibaba, the world’s three biggest retailers, are trembling. No one has fully mastered the art of selling groceries online. The business represents just 2.3%, or $160bn, of a worldwide grocery market of $7trn. As that share rises, as it will surely continue to, it could be life or death for some in the industry. 

In the midst of this `mêlée`<sup>混战</sup> is a fast-talking Brit, Tim Steiner. The firm he co-founded, Ocado, has shaken up the British online retail market, and it is trying to do the same internationally. By selling expertise from almost 20 years as a pioneering online grocer to supermarkets in America and elsewhere, he wants to help them become a fourth force in the industry—able to resist the big three. 

His patter is honed by a career battling doubters (an analyst once put him down with the [`quip`](  "A quip is a remark that is intended be amusing or clever. 俏皮话; 妙语"): “Ocado begins with an ‘o’, ends with an ‘o’, and is worth zero”). Sceptics still harbour deep reservations. Though Ocado has more than tripled in value in the past two years to £7.5bn ($9.6bn), its share price has plunged recently. But his insurgency shows how the battle to dominate online groceries remains wide open. Ocado has as good a chance as anyone. 

Grocery is a `sadomasochistic`<sup> 施虐受虐狂的</sup> business. Sellers can count on stable revenues but have little margin for error on sourcing, price and waste. Shoppers suffer from a retail version of Stockholm syndrome. They are lured by grocers with the promise of savings, only to be fleeced. Shops make them do the work of picking the produce and bagging it. They set traps in the aisles—in the form of strategically placed celebrity magazines or freshly baked doughnuts—to slow shoppers down. Yet customers continue to return for more, despite having ever more options to order online and have groceries delivered to their doorstep. In China and America, online grocery shopping is a miserly 3.8% and 1.6% of the total, respectively. 

Mr Steiner, a former Goldman Sachs bond trader, has pulled off the rare feat of making home-delivery both tolerable for shoppers and profitable for sellers. He knows how to squeeze the last farthing out of a tomato and has turned the sorting of groceries in warehouses into a science—specifically, clever robotics—which has kept costs competitive. Partly thanks to Ocado, Britain trails only South Korea and Japan in its embrace of online grocers. 

Earlier this year Mr Steiner persuaded Marks & Spencer, a British retailer, to pay £750m for a half of Ocado’s domestic online-grocery business. The money is helping develop his firm’s newer, more lucrative international venture, which licenses the know-how to build modular high-tech warehouses that can be scaled up as needed. The biggest deal, struck in 2018, has been with Kroger. The American supermarket chain aims to order 20 Ocado customer fulfilment centres (CFCs, or, as Kroger calls them, sheds) by 2021, far more than the four that Ocado has so far erected in Britain (the newest burned down this year). Despite their recent slide Ocado’s shares still trade like a software firm’s, not a supermarket’s. JPMorgan Cazenove, a broker, said last month that the firm would need to announce 126 CFCs to justify a recent valuation of £9bn, three times the number it has planned. 

Kroger’s sheds, which may take up to five years to complete, already give a sense of the emerging grocery battle lines. They will be big, up to about 33,000 square metres (350,000 square feet), though they can be flexed up and down. They will sit on the edge of cities. Ocado aims to make up for the long drives to deliver groceries by speeding up its robots, packing crates of 50 items in six to seven minutes. There will be no time-pressed “pickers” elbowing shoppers aside to fill an online order, as in other supermarkets. 

But the Ocado model, which works well in urban Britain, is as yet untested in more sparsely populated places. In America and China others are moving in a different direction—and in a hurry. 

In 2017 Amazon sent shivers down American grocers’ spines by buying Whole Foods. On November 11th it confirmed that it was opening its first grocery store in California that is not part of that upscale chain. Last month it launched free delivery of Amazon Fresh, a grocery service, to its Prime members. So far its bark has been worse than its bite. By one estimate only 6% of its sales are [`perishables`]( "Goods such as food that are perishable go bad after a short length of time. (食物)易腐烂的; 易变质的"), compared with 65% at a traditional grocer. 

Amazon’s domestic rivals are making existing supermarkets the kernel of their online operations, either for picking up orders or delivering them. Close by will be micro-fulfilment centres, which will seek to emulate Ocado’s efficiency, but cut down on travel times. The model is Walmart, which cited sharp growth in online grocery from its supercentres in America as a reason for higher sales this summer. Last month it launched a service in which employees in three American cities can deliver groceries directly to customers’ fridges when no one is home, using smart-entry technology and wearable cameras. It also promises same-day delivery under a membership programme like Amazon Prime. 

Alibaba’s high-tech Hema supermarkets in China are more cutting-edge still. They use QR codes on fish to validate freshness, enable app-based shopping, have robots aplenty (naturally) and offer 30-minute delivery within a small radius. Yet it is unclear if Hema’s technology will succeed where armies of cheap labour, ready to sort, pick and deliver groceries, have mostly failed. 

No one has as yet quite cracked the problem. More wizardry, perhaps virtual-reality headsets, may be required to make internet grocery shopping as intuitive for people as it is offline. But the incentives for grocers to press ahead are huge. No relationship in retail is as intense as that of shoppers with their supermarket. Few firms have as many eggs in the online-shopping basket as Ocado. If things do not work out, at least the Kroger deal has made Mr Steiner a rich man. If they do, he may be a rare example of a British entrepreneur with global ambitions who is not off his trolley.

<h3 id="5.4">Octogenarians are shaking up Italian business</h3>

CARLO DE BENEDETTI is fond of high drama. When he resigned after only three months as chief executive of Fiat in 1976, rumours swirled that he was cobbling together a bid for the then-ailing carmaker with the help of Swiss financiers. Mr De Benedetti denied ever having such designs. But he seemed to relish all the attention. 

Mr De Benedetti, who turned 85 on November 14th, is back centre-stage of Italian business with another [`unorthodox`](  "If you describe someone's behaviour, beliefs, or customs as unorthodox, you mean that they are different from what is generally accepted. 非正统的; 另类的") bid. Last month he offered €38m ($42m) to buy a 29.9% stake of GEDI Gruppo Editoriale, publisher of newspapers including La Stampa and La Repubblica, as part of a plan to relaunch the business, which is currently run by his sons, Marco and Rodolfo. His offspring have “neither the skills nor the passion required to be publishers”, he lamented in an interview with Corriere della Sera, a rival daily. GEDI was a ship without a captain, at the mercy of high waves, according to the patriarch. On October 28th he resigned as honorary chairman of GEDI. (Exor, a holding company whose chairman sits on the board of The Economist’s parent company, has a 6% stake in GEDI.) 

Mr De Benedetti’s return may be particularly operatic, but other Italian Methuselahs are also in the spotlight. Stefano Pessina, the 78-year-old billionaire who is both the boss and the biggest shareholder of Walgreens Boots Alliance is exploring a deal to take the struggling American drugstore chain private. On November 11th KKR, an American private-equity giant which teamed up with Mr Pessina in 2007 to buy Alliance Boots, made a formal offer for Walgreens. The $70bn buy-out would be the largest in history. Days earlier data from Consob, an Italian securities regulator, revealed that Leonardo Del Vecchio, founder of Luxottica, a maker of spectacles (including Ray-Ban and Oakley sunglasses), who is 84, has just boosted to nearly 10% his stake in Mediobanca, an influential investment bank. Mr Del Vecchio is expected to increase his stake further. Italy’s second-richest man is challenging Mediobanca to build up its investment-banking business and to rely less on income from its stake in Generali, Italy’s biggest insurer (of which Mr Del Vecchio also owns a chunk). 

Another 84-year-old, Luciano Benetton, is again getting involved in the business of making colourful clothes that first made his family’s name. A revival of the fashion business may help divert attention from the clan’s infrastructure business. This was hurt by the tragic collapse last year of a bridge in Genoa managed by Autostrade, a `toll-road`<sup>收费道路</sup> operator owned by a holding company the Benettons control. 

Ageing patriarchs who are [`reluctant`](    "If you are reluctant to do something, you are unwilling to do it and hesitate before doing it, or do it slowly and without enthusiasm. 不愿意的; 勉强的") to bow out, or so much as plan for the day when nature will eventually force them to, are a feature of Italian capitalism. Giorgio Armani is running his fashion empire at the age of 85. Silvio Berlusconi, Italy’s 83-year-old former prime minister, remains the power behind the throne at Mediaset, Italy’s biggest commercial broadcaster (which is run by his son, Pier Silvio). When Bernardo Caprotti died three years ago aged 90 he was still managing Esselunga, a supermarket chain he founded. 

In the past ten years the leadership of companies has been rejuvenated, observes Franceso Giavazzi at Bocconi University in Milan. But, as Raffaella Sadun of Harvard Business School points out, that may be because founders put younger family members in charge as a way of retaining control. “It is not clear their relations are the best people for the job,” she says. Plenty of talented managers are reluctant to join firms where their career prospects would be subordinated to feckless scions. The mid-sized companies of Germany’s Mittelstand could teach corporate Italy a thing or two about how to handle succession, Ms Sadun says. 

The younger De Benedettis were taken [`aback`]( "If you are taken aback by something, you are surprised or shocked by it and you cannot respond at once. 被…所震惊") by the paternal foray. Despite a sharp decline in third-quarter profits, they insist that the group needs no restructuring. At least the fatherly bid, however hurtful, could be [`lucrative`](    "A lucrative activity, job, or business deal is very profitable. 获利丰厚的"). In 2012 Mr De Benedetti gave Rodolfo, Marco and his third son, Edoardo, his stake in CIR, a holding company which owns 44% of GEDI. Each would pocket millions if he bought it back.

<h3 id="5.5">One for the money</h3>

IN 1993 A group of male students at Nanjing University in China decided to celebrate their singledom. The annual date would be November 11th, comprised of four lonely 1s. The story may be `apocryphal`<sup></sup>. But since 2009 Alibaba, China’s e-commerce giant, has turned Singles’ Day into a very real shopping frenzy. It has long since `eclipsed`<sup>使失色</sup> America’s Black Friday and Cyber Monday online sales combined. This year Taylor Swift performed at the countdown. In the next 24 hours Alibaba sold $38.4bn-worth of merchandise. Competitors like jd.com and Pinduoduo have piled in. Some people worry that what began as a `lighthearted`<sup>快乐的</sup> excuse to treat oneself has turned into a high-pressure version of Valentine’s Day. Others `decry`<sup>责难</sup> the harsh conditions workers face in order to meet demand and the holiday’s environmental impact. But shoppers certainly seem to like it.

<h3 id="5.6">Proxy advisers come under fire</h3>

PROXY ADVISORY services used to be an obscure feature of corporate America. No longer. These geeky outfits, which review mountains of proposals put forward by shareholders on topics ranging from mergers and executive pay to climate change and diversity, then issue recommendations, can sway how their clients vote. Given that most are big institutional investors with clout, this advice matters. Earlier this year analysts at Credit Suisse, an investment bank, predicted that proxy advisers’ counsel would decide the fate of Bristol-Myers Squibb’s [`mammoth`](    "You can use mammoth to emphasize that a task or change is very large and needs a lot of effort to achieve. 巨大的; 艰巨的") $74bn bid for Celgene, a rival drugmaker. 

Big institutional investors like Capital Group and Fidelity have in-house teams to deal with such matters. But most funds rely on outside advisers. Two of them dominate the business. Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), owned by Genstar, an American private-equity firm, provides proxy recommendations on over 40,000 shareholder meetings in more than 100 countries each year. Glass Lewis informs some 20,000 votes in 100 countries. It is owned by two Canadian asset managers. Between them, ISS and Glass Lewis control 97% of America’s proxy-advice market. 

Their client base has boomed. In 1950 institutions held only 10% of American shares. By 2018 it was close to 80%. As shareholder activism has grown in America, so have proxy battles—from 270 campaigns in 2012 to over 300 this year. [`Proliferating`](  "If things proliferate, they increase in number very quickly. 激增") passive investment funds, led by Vanguard, are keenly handing their voting rights over to proxy advisers. 

Business lobbies have had enough. “We have been concerned about proxy advisory firms for some time,” says Tom Quaadman of the US Chamber of Commerce. He argues that they lack transparency and have “significant” conflicts of interest arising from their consulting divisions, which advise companies on improving corporate governance. A report from the chamber last year [`bemoaned`](   "If you bemoan something, you express sorrow or dissatisfaction about it. 惋惜; 埋怨") an onslaught of “zombie proposals”, which come up repeatedly—and repeatedly fail to win a majority of votes. 

In August America’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) ruled that voting recommendations made by the advisers amounted to “solicitations” under proxy rules, a higher regulatory standard than the firms faced before. They would, for instance, have to prove compliance with anti-fraud provisions. ISS filed a lawsuit in response. On November 5th the SEC proposed more rule changes, “to improve the accuracy and transparency of proxy voting advice”. Among other things, these would raise the minimum share of votes required for shareholder proposals to succeed and let target firms review proxy recommendations twice before investors see them. 

Corporate groups are `cock-a-hoop`<sup>得意洋洋</sup>. The National Association of Manufacturers, one of those spearheading the proxy war, declared that the proposal was “a significant victory” that “sets up reasonable guardrails” on the proxy process. Joseph Grundfest of Stanford Law School sees nothing wrong with giving firms the chance to challenge the factual basis of recommendations: “As long as ISS is accurate in everything it does, it has no additional legal `liability`<sup>责任</sup>.” 

Nonsense, say critics of the new provisions, who liken them to slapping a tax on advice critical of management. Charles Elson of the University of Delaware argues the SEC proposal is “a punitive solution looking for a problem”. He believes that business chambers’ claims of vast numbers of errors in proxy recommendations are overblown. It is telling that few of the proxy advisory firms’ institutional clients, who would be most affected by erroneous or conflicted advice, are complaining. 

On the contrary. “The goal of the co-ordinated, corporate-funded campaigns…is to make it harder and more expensive for institutional investors to get the expert advice they need to hold executives accountable,” says the Council of Institutional Investors, which represents funds with $4trn in assets under management. Chris Ailman of the California State Teachers’ Retirement System, which has $242bn in assets, fears a return to “egregious management behaviour”. “People have forgotten Enron and WorldCom,” he warns, referring to two huge corporate-fraud scandals in the early 2000s. 

Drew Chapman of Baker Botts, a law firm, sees the proposed rule changes as `double-edged`<sup>对双方皆不利的</sup>. More transparency should in principle benefit investors. But tougher solicitation rules may make it easier for a firm’s management to sue the proxy firms over advice it does not like—possibly discouraging them from being overly critical. 

The SEC’s proposal now enters a 60-day comment period. The regulator is expected to make a final ruling early next year. The advisory firms may then challenge it in court. That could stretch the fight out by months, or even years. 

Another outcome is possible. The SEC could instead modify the proposal to soften its sharp edges. This would push proxy firms to be more transparent, especially about possible conflicts of interest, but without burdening them with costly new regulations and reporting requirements. Robert Jackson, a dissenting commissioner on the SEC (and rare regulator with deep expertise in data analytics), makes the economic case for [`finesse`]( "If you do something with finesse, you do it with great skill and style. 技巧; 策略"). 

Mr Jackson’s research suggests that bosses are right to complain about [`nuisance`](    "If you say that someone or something is a nuisance, you mean that they annoy you or cause you a lot of problems. 令人讨厌的人或事物; 麻烦的人或事情") proposals. Shareholder votes put forward by “gadflies”—the ten most prolific submitters in any given year—coincided with declines in returns at American target firms in the months following a shareholder meeting. However, listed American firms which faced non-gadfly proposals outperformed the market by 5% one year after the shareholder meeting at which they were presented was held. 

That implies that any final SEC ruling should put off gadflies, but not other proposals that would keep managements honest. Doing this will not be easy. But the SEC can surely do better than its current suggestions. These seem overly kind to managers—and, in Mr Jackson’s words, “swat at a gadfly with a sledgehammer”.

<h3 id="6.1">Obituary: Anwar Congo died on October 25th</h3>

THE FIRST time he tried to kill a man, he used a [`stinky`](    "If something is stinky, it smells extremely unpleasant. 发恶臭的") durian fruit. It didn’t work. Eventually, he came to the view that the most efficient method was `garrotting`<sup>（用铁丝等）勒死</sup>, and he was proud of how [`adept`](    "Someone who is adept at something can do it skilfully. 娴熟的") he became with the wire. It hadn’t always been so. 

He was born in Medan, a [`grimy`](  "Something that is grimy is very dirty. 肮脏的") industrial town in northern Sumatra that was home to Pancasila Youth, the main semi-official political gangster group that flourished as Indonesia’s military dictatorship grew ever more powerful in the mid-1960s. An attempted coup by leftists in 1965 had given the army the excuse it needed to unleash an orgy of killing across the country. Anybody opposed to the army could be accused of being a communist. As America became enmeshed in the Vietnam war, and the fear of communism’s possible domino effect across Asia took hold in the West, President Lyndon B. Johnson and his allies were happy to look away as more than a million alleged communists were tortured and killed, many of them Chinese Indonesians. 

Known as preman, from the English words “free men”, Pancasila’s death squads, with their political connections and their can-do/will-do `swagger`<sup>吓唬</sup>, proved the ideal recruiting ground for a boy like Anwar Congo. He had dropped out of school at the age of 12 and spent much of his time selling bootleg cinema tickets with his friends outside Medan’s main picture house. Dressed in a cowboy hat and a braided leather necktie complete with Texas star, he imagined himself as a skinny John Wayne, or, in a dark Panama and shades, as one of the mobster types in “Murder, Inc”. It was all a bit of a lark, until someone tried to ban American films, and the gangsters’ business slumped. 

As he grew older, he moved from cinema tickets into petty smuggling and illegal gambling, and soon he came to the attention of men like Ibrahim Sinik, a newspaper publisher and paramilitary gang boss. Mr Sinik decided who got killed in Medan and who should merely be shaken down for money. He needed protection, and the young film buff was just the guy to provide it. He’d go to a musical film in the afternoon, then sidle across the street—high on show tunes—and hop up the stairs to the roof of Sinik’s newspaper office where he changed into jeans or thick trousers and set to work. In the early days, he beat his victims to death. But there was so much blood. Even after it was cleaned up, it still stank. To avoid the mess, he switched to wire. With a wooden slat at either end, it was quick and clean. So many people were killed on that roof terrace, it was known as “the office of blood”. He is reckoned to have murdered at least 1,000 people with his own hands, and soon had his own gang known as the Frog Squad. 

When, at last, the killing came to an end in 1968, he moved into organising political muscle, clearing land for illegal logging. And there, in humanity’s dark shadows, he might have remained, were it not for the fact that in 2005, exactly 40 years after the genocide began, he met an idealistic young American-born documentary-maker named Joshua Oppenheimer. Thus began the second life of Anwar Congo. 

He was the 41st killer to be interviewed by Mr Oppenheimer. He gloated over how they used to crush their victims’ necks with wooden staves, how they hanged them, strangled them, cut off their heads, ran them over with cars—all because they were allowed to. And he insisted that they never felt guilty, never got depressed, never had nightmares. Dressed in white slacks and a lime Hawaiian shirt the first day he met the film-makers, he led them up to Mr Sinik’s roof and showed them in person, demonstrating on a friend, how he had garrotted his victims. And how afterwards, he would put on some good music, drink a little booze, smoke a little marijuana. Stepping lightly across the roof, he crooned: “Cha, cha, cha.” By now in his 60s and missing several teeth, he clacked his dentures when the camera began rolling. 

At home, he served the film-maker sweet tea. While the two men discussed what film they might make, he taught a young boy how to care for his pet duckling. He roped in his Pancasila friends to re-enact what they had done. The directors gave them carte blanche. The gangsters sketched out interrogations and how they beat women and burned down villages. Aided by a fat [`sidekick`](   "Someone's sidekick is a person who accompanies them and helps them, and who you consider to be less intelligent or less important than the other person. 助手") in drag, with bright lipstick and lime eyeshadow, they even re-enacted a beheading, and how afterwards they ate the victim’s liver. 

In the evening they watched the day’s rushes. Sometimes, wearing a burgundy Panama hat, he played one of the interrogators: “It must be fun being a communist. You fuck other people’s wives.” Or he’d play the film-maker, sitting high up in the cameraman’s chair, wholly consumed with panning across a scene of make-believe. 

And then, one day, he cast himself as a victim. He sat in the chair on the far side of the interrogator’s wooden desk. His shiny charcoal suit turned dark as he sweated at being questioned. After the wire was slipped around his neck, his right hand began to shake. “Did the people I tortured feel the way I do here?” he asked. “I felt all the terror possess my body.” 

“No,” Mr Oppenheimer quietly replied. “You’re making a film. They knew they were going to be murdered.” 

“The Act of Killing”, or Jagal as it was called in Indonesian, meaning “Butcher”, was tipped to win an Oscar when it was released in 2012. It became the country’s most viewed film after the producers made it available free online, and Indonesians began talking about the years of living dangerously in a way they never had before. 

As for Mr Congo, he `evaded`<sup>逃避</sup> justice, but not punishment. The garrotting stayed with him. It was, he said, one of the easiest ways of taking a human life. When, on the final day of the shoot that had lasted five years, he was filmed returning, in a mustard double-breasted suit and lemony shirt, to the roof of Mr Sinik’s office, where so many men had died by his hand, he sniffed the night air and then he gulped. Turning away, he [`retched`]( "If you retch, your stomach moves as if you are vomiting. 作呕; 反胃; 恶心") and retched—until he could retch no longer.

<h3 id="7.1">A Kurt Vonnegut museum opens in Indianapolis</h3>

ON INDIANA AVENUE in Indianapolis, Indiana stands the new Kurt Vonnegut Museum and Library. Its [`repetitious`](    "Something that is repetitious involves actions or elements that are repeated many times and is therefore boring. 反复的; 重复乏味的") address chimes with its subject’s views on geography and belonging. Vonnegut believed that a person should never forget where he came from. “All my jokes are Indianapolis,” he once said. “All my attitudes are Indianapolis. My adenoids are Indianapolis. If I ever severed myself from Indianapolis, I would be out of business. What people like about me is Indianapolis.” As much as he mocked the term—and those who used it—in his novel “Cat’s Cradle” (1963), Vonnegut was a `bona fide`<sup>真诚的</sup> Hoosier. 

Indianapolis is not known for its literature. It is overshadowed by America’s coastal cities and its bigger neighbour on Lake Michigan. Vonnegut himself is associated with other places: Cape Cod, where he ran a car dealership; upstate New York, where he was a PR man for General Electric; Chicago, where he learned to be a journalist and failed to earn a master’s degree. 

Nevertheless, the Vonnegut museum belongs in Indianapolis, where he was born and grew up, says Julia Whitehead, its founder and boss. “There’s a lack of arrogance here,” she reckons, “a humility” that is distilled in his prose. The opening of the museum coincides with the 50th anniversary of the publication of Vonnegut’s most famous novel, “`Slaughterhouse`?<sup>屠宰场</sup>-Five”, which propelled him to fame. Half a century on, the book—and the author—still feel contemporary. 

“Slaughterhouse-Five” was distinguished by its grim yet wildly imaginative portrayal of the second world war, which combines sci-fi motifs and a distorted chronology with moral clarity. The protagonist, Billy Pilgrim, is no Captain America. He trudges passively through Germany with his fellow prisoners of war wearing silver boots, a fur-collared coat many sizes too small, and a blue toga. Eventually, he decides to tell the world about his kidnap by aliens from the planet Tralfamadore. He is shot and killed soon afterwards by a fellow former captive. Experienced time-traveller that he is, Billy knew his death was coming. He had seen it many times. 

The book transmuted the [`trauma`]( "Trauma is a very severe shock or very upsetting experience, which may cause psychological damage. (精神上的) 创伤; 痛苦经历") Vonnegut himself suffered while witnessing the firebombing of Dresden as a prisoner of war in 1945. When the museum opened on November 9th, many of the first visitors were veterans; several said their experiences of Vietnam, Korea or Afghanistan were reflected in Billy’s odyssey through time and space. There are no evil characters in his story, only ugly realities. When, towards the end, he is recuperating from a plane crash, his hospital bunk-mate, an air-force historian, mentions Dresden’s destruction. He asks Billy to “pity the men who had to do it”. Billy does. 

What explains Vonnegut’s enduring appeal to readers from other generations and backgrounds, who have never seen war first-hand? An unassuming candour that is native to the American Midwest, argues Ms Whitehead, a quality that disarms readers and forces them to confront eternal questions. His books are not simply criticisms of war; they are meditations on human nature and the meaning of life, wrapped up in zany plots and deadpan wit. 

Still, the idea of a Vonnegut museum may seem odd. The author was a slouchy hero of the 1960s and 1970s counterculture: an anti-establishment, anti-war, satirical pessimist with a self-professed penchant for late-night drunken phone calls and Pall Mall cigarettes. He was full of contradictions. “When vivisected”, he conceded, “the beliefs I have to defend…turn into bowls of undifferentiated mush.” He listed them `wryly`<sup>挖苦地</sup>: “I am a pacifist, I am an anarchist, I am a planetary citizen, and so on.” 

Together, though, the museum’s collection of personal effects, rejection letters and art inspired by his writing attests to a set of [`steadfast`]( "If someone is steadfast in something that they are doing, they are convinced that what they are doing is right and they refuse to change it or to give up. 坚定的") beliefs, which continue to inspire readers. Vonnegut was an unyielding advocate for free speech and the arts. He wrote about the importance of community and family. He thought that everyone should be kind, goddammit, and that death was neither good nor bad, merely inevitable. Vonnegut himself died in 2007; humble as he was, says Ms Whitehead, “he might be a little bit embarrassed about a building with his name on it.”

<h3 id="7.2">Has The Economist made history, as well as reporting it?</h3>

Liberalism at Large: The World According to the Economist. By Alexander Zevin. Verso; 544 pages; $34.95 and £25. 

“I AM NOT a dedicated reader of The Economist,” confessed Roy Jenkins, a British statesman who died in 2003; it is “essentially a journal for foreigners”. Luckily for the newspaper, most people are foreigners. This may be one reason why it thrives at the age of 176, with a larger print circulation than it had before the internet. 

According to Alexander Zevin, a historian at the City University of New York, The Economist is not merely a spectator of global affairs but an actor in them. It “shaped the very world its readers inhabit”, because of its links to politicians and financiers. “Liberalism at Large: The World According to the Economist” is based on his doctoral dissertation, which examined the weekly from its birth in 1843 to 1938. It supplements and updates Ruth Dudley Edwards’s more-or-less official account, “The Pursuit of Reason: The Economist 1843-1993”. 

Yet the two authors tell very different tales. Ms Dudley Edwards identified The Economist’s creed as the belief that governments are more imperfect than markets. Mr Zevin is more oblique. He aims to present the annals of The Economist as “a history of liberalism”. The paper, he argues, has been guided by “the universal virtues of capital and…necessities of empire”. Since this brand of “liberal” thought has, he says, been the most consequential one, The Economist’s history is also that of “actually existing liberalism”—a nod to a Marxist term for the ugly realities of capitalism. 

Ms Dudley Edwards thought The Economist’s main defects were “arrogance, priggishness, absence of doubt, frequent failures of imagination and too-clever-by-halfery”. Mr Zevin’s judgment is harsher. The result of following The Economist’s advice about the Irish famine of the 1840s was “on par with the better-known holocausts of the twentieth century”. A decade later, the paper was “just as ruthless with Indians as with the Irish or Chinese”. And after championing light regulation in the late 20th century, its response to the crash of 2008 was “breathtakingly unrepentant”. Mr Zevin does not actually say the post-war Economist has been a market-fundamentalist `lickspittle`<sup>奉承者</sup> of Western intelligence agencies, but that is the politely expressed drift. 

If The Economist has ever got anything right, readers don’t hear much about it. Nor is there much acknowledgment that markets ever work—for example, by delivering a seismic drop in global poverty since the 1980s. A `parodic`<sup>具有讽刺喜剧效果的</sup> `gibe`<sup>嘲笑</sup> at globalisation’s critics from an editorial in 2003 springs to mind: “Show us an economic miracle, and we will show you the failure of capitalism.” 

Given its heartless perfidy, it is perhaps odd that The Economist is read by anyone outside the ermined ranks of “the `aristocracy`<sup>贵族</sup> of finance”, to quote Marx’s description of its audience in 1852. Yet it is. And according to the Pew Research Centre, an American think-tank, its readership in its largest market skews left. Pew classifies 18% of American readers as mostly or consistently conservative, and 59% as mostly or consistently “liberal” (in the American sense, left-wing in the British one). 

“Ideas have mattered most” to The Economist’s success, Mr Zevin believes. That is questionable. Engaging with its editorials is no doubt part of its appeal. Yet they account for only around 5% of articles; what most distinguishes the rest is their way of dealing with the news. Brevity abounds. So do charts. Dispatches from 21 foreign bureaus are, in a good week, put in a global and historical context. There are, in short, more facts per square inch than in perhaps any other weekend reading matter. 

Mr Zevin is not the first to tie himself in knots trying to define liberalism. The Economist sometimes does the same. He is to be thanked for a critique of the paper which, though skewed, pays it the compliment of taking it very seriously.

<h3 id="7.3">How to talk about unspeakable things</h3>

IT IS A cliché that three topics should stay off-limits in polite company: politics, religion and sex. But there are times for hard conversations, and the language used to talk about sex, and particularly sexual [`misdeeds`](   "A misdeed is a bad or evil act. 不端行为; 恶行"), remains wrapped in a gauze of misdirection and euphemism that risks contributing to harm, even when intentions are good. 

A recent case in Barcelona illustrates the power of language. Five men who gang-raped an unconscious 14-year-old girl were convicted of mere “sexual abuse”—not the graver “sexual assault”, because technically they had not used violence or `intimidation`<sup>恐吓</sup>, as required by the statute. 

The furious protesters who turned out in Barcelona and other cities were not angry about the court’s leniency `per se`<sup>本身</sup>: the rapists received fairly long prison sentences. Rather they are demanding that the law be changed so that “sexual assault” reflects the absence of consent, rather than the use of force. In other words, they are asking politicians to redefine that term.  

There is an irony in their protest. Demonstrators shouted “No es abuso, es violación” (it’s not abuse; it’s rape). But the Spanish word “violación” itself clearly displays its etymological link to “violence”, the lack of which was at the heart of the controversy. Other European languages also reflect a historical belief that rape is, by definition, violent: Vergewaltigung in German includes Gewalt, violence, for instance. 

Or consider the English word. Coming from Latin rapere, its oldest sense involves neither sex nor bodily harm; it means to take something by force (as in the adjective, “rapacious”). This represents the attitude of many centuries in which rape was considered a property crime against a husband or father, robbing them of a woman’s virginity or chastity, which were the father’s to give away to a spouse. It was not something done to the woman herself. 

Fortunately, feminists long ago succeeded in placing the woman’s experience at the heart of the matter. But “rape” is now such a powerful and painful word that English-speakers have developed a hazier vocabulary to talk about and around it instead. “Sexual assault” rose in prominence in the 1970s. Its adoption reflected the fact that there were many ways to commit, and experience, traumatic sexual violence; the kind that could rob a woman of her virginity was only one, and need not always be privileged over others. Numerous American states and Canada, for example, no longer have a crime called “rape” on the statute books, but rather varying degrees of sexual assault. 

The breadth of the label “sexual assault” has its uses—for example, when statisticians want to aggregate different offences. It can convey the sense of violation that comes with all its manifestations. It gives women who have suffered different kinds of harms an umbrella of solidarity. Finally, victims who use “sexual assault” may themselves not want to be more specific. 

But there are unintended consequences. Sexual assault is usually defined (for example, by American and British authorities) as sexual contact without consent. This means that the gamut runs widely, from groping to the most savage rapes. That can make it hard for those not directly involved to understand the gravity of individual cases. It might even let the most `vicious`<sup>恶毒的</sup> rapists take advantage of a perception that perhaps they committed a lesser crime. 

And the old words are often the most powerful. Activists have berated newspapers which reported that Jeffrey Epstein, a disgraced and now-dead financier, “cavorted” with “underage women”; he raped and trafficked teenage girls. Similarly, some want to ditch the term “child pornography”, since it refers to a heinous criminal enterprise, not consenting performances as in the adult kind. It sometimes seems people cannot talk about sexual violence except in terms adapted from consensual relations. 

Now feminists are saying “we need to talk about rape”, as Deborah Cameron, a linguist, does in a recent post on her blog, “Language: a feminist guide”.Applying the right vocabulary to a crime will not curtail it, but the abstractions and legalese common in the media and politics can drain the task of urgency, by making the scourge seem less acute. Just as “murder” should not be routinely dressed up as “homicide”, nor “torture” consigned to the catch-all bin of “human-rights abuses”, so it is with the vocabulary of sexual abuse. It is hard to tackle a problem you are afraid to name.

<h3 id="7.4">Some building works threaten Turkish antiquities. Others save them</h3>

IT WAS 2009 and Antakya, a city in southern Turkey known in antiquity as Antioch, was thriving. Tourists were visiting it in record numbers. Trade with neighbouring Syria was booming. Sensing an opportunity, Necmi Asfuroglu, a local businessman, decided to build an upmarket hotel on land that he had owned since the 1990s. The plot was only a few hundred metres from the Grotto of St Peter, one of the world’s oldest churches. 

Before construction could start, a team of archaeologists was called in to examine the site. They excavated a broken amphora here, a statue there, and almost everywhere colourful mosaic pieces, spread across an area of some 17,000 square metres. By the time they had finished, they had unearthed parts of what had once been the heart of Antioch, one of the biggest cities of the Roman empire. The finds included a bathhouse, a huge marble-floored forum, thousands of artefacts and the world’s largest floor mosaic. 

With these discoveries, Mr Asfuroglu’s plans went up in smoke. “We had to rethink everything,” he says. Rather than walk away from the project, he asked an Istanbul architect, Emre Arolat, to design a structure that would accommodate both a modern hotel and an archaeological museum. Construction began in 2010, but stopped again for almost two years after workers came across another dazzling mosaic, depicting a winged Pegasus attended by three nymphs. It finally ended earlier this year. 

For Mr Arolat, the challenge was to find an architectural language that merged what he calls the “sacred” of an archaeological site and the “profane” of a business venture. For inspiration, he says, he looked to a museum showcasing the medieval ruins of a Norwegian town, designed by Sverre Fehn, and the paths around the Acropolis devised by Dimitris Pikionis. The result is a hybrid that exemplifies how conservation and commerce can profitably coexist. 

From the outside, the “museum hotel” that Mr Arolat designed resembles a steel and glass Jenga tower lying on its side and stacked with long rectangular blocks the size of shipping containers, each housing a hotel room. The interior is a vast open space criss-crossed by bridges and walkways that overlook the mosaics and ruins below. The whole structure rests on over 60 columns. One entrance serves the hotel, another the publicly accessible museum. 

In Turkey, where the earth teems with the relics of dozens of ancient civilisations—and where over the past couple of decades the economy has been powered by a construction frenzy—development regularly takes priority over heritage. This hierarchy applies to small and mega-projects alike. A few years ago, when the discovery of three dozen Byzantine shipwrecks and a Neolithic settlement from the sixth millennium BC delayed the opening of a tunnel under the Bosporus, Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, scolded the researchers who caused “three to five pots and pans” to hold up progress. More recently, flooding from a hydroelectric dam on the Tigris river has begun to submerge one of the longest continuously inhabited places on Earth, a 12,000-year-old town in Turkey’s south-east. 

Yet for all the cultural [`depredations`](  "The depredations of a person, animal, or force are their harmful actions, which usually involve taking or damaging something. 掠夺; 破坏") that they sometimes entail, development projects can help save ancient treasures, too. Indeed, reckons Gul Pulhan, an archaeologist at the British Institute at Ankara, a research centre, such ventures are becoming the only way that archaeology can be done. Bureaucracy partly explains that paradox: foreign and local researchers who apply for excavation permits in Turkey have to jump through countless hoops. (The memory of European archaeologists who plundered Ottoman lands in the 18th and 19th centuries might be to blame for this rigmarole.) Another reason is money. “Across the world, there is less and less money available for archaeological work,” says Ms Pulhan. Turkey is no exception. 

The outlook changes, however, when a commercial or infrastructure scheme is `at stake`<sup>处于危险中</sup>. “The bureaucracy is lighter and friendlier because they want to support those projects,” Ms Pulhan says. Finance is also available more readily, since developers in Turkey and elsewhere are required by law to cover the costs of excavation (though frequently they shelve their plans to avoid the expense). In Antakya, a necropolis unearthed during previous construction eventually became a museum. In Istanbul a hotel project recently uncovered a Byzantine road. In London, meanwhile, Bloomberg’s new headquarters incorporates a Roman temple, which is open to the public. 

Bankrolling archaeology in this way is not an ideal solution. Excavation risks being rushed, because investors want to get on with the job. Archaeologists may be tempted or forced to cut corners. But improvisations like the museum hotel in Antakya might be the best available approach. “Had it not been for that project, probably none of those things would have been unearthed,” says Ms Pulhan. 

Seeing it through to the end was not easy. Soon after construction began, war broke out across the border in Syria, sending millions of refugees into Turkey and deterring tourism. The economy took a turn for the worse. Because of the `excavations`<sup>挖掘</sup>, the delays and the changes to the design, “we had to spend three times more than we planned,” recalls Mr Asfuroglu’s daughter, Sabiha Asfuroglu Abbasoglu, who oversaw the development. The final cost came to $120m. 

“We had to sell some of our other properties, but we never gave up,” Ms Abbasoglu says, standing next to the site’s centrepiece, a giant mosaic that seems to float above ground like a magic carpet, the effect of centuries of earthquakes and floods that caused some of its parts to rise and others to sink. Ms Abbasoglu says she hopes the outcome will be an example to others. The next developer who stumbles upon a few pots and pans might want to take note.

<h3 id="7.5">The glittering rise of the Cartiers</h3>

The Cartiers. By Francesca Cartier Brickell. Ballantine Books; 656 pages; $35. 

BY THE AGE of 40, Louis-François Cartier had not only risen from poverty to open his own jewellery shop in Paris, he had seen it through revolution and a coup d’état, economic doldrums and a fire. Fiscal prudence and pragmatism were vital virtues, he considered, and he instilled them in his son and grandsons. He also imparted a less routine lesson: “Be very kind.” 

Francesca Cartier Brickell—Louis-François’s great-great-great-granddaughter—has drawn on a forgotten cache of family correspondence to string together a dynamic group biography studded with design history and high-society dash. Its stars are the founder’s grandsons, who, during the first half of the 20th century, transformed Maison Cartier into an international luxury brand with a clientele as glittering as its bejewelled wares, pulling off feats of social climbing as they went. 

The brothers faced their own challenges, including two world wars, the Great Depression and an inexorable drift towards more casual fashions. Their strength lay in their closeness and complementary talents. Louis, the eldest, could be hot-headed: he once challenged a Rothschild baron to a duel over a snub. But his creativity fuelled innovations such as the use of platinum for more delicate settings and Cartier’s famous “mystery clocks” (their hands appeared to hover in thin air as if “woven from moonbeams”). J.P. Morgan was a fan. 

Pierre, meanwhile, had an `innate`<sup>先天的</sup> grasp of markets and motivation. He allowed undecided clients to take jewels home with them for a few days, confident that they would find it hard to return them—even when the piece in question was the legendary Hope Diamond. In 1916 he traded a pearl necklace for the town house on Fifth Avenue that remains the company’s American headquarters. The youngest brother, Jacques, who had yearned to become a Catholic priest, travelled to India and the Persian Gulf, expanding the firm’s reach. 


From gem-hunting expeditions to a heist, theirs is a dramatic saga. It is further enlivened by the jewel-encrusted maharajahs, mistresses and movie stars who paraded through the Cartier showrooms. For sheer zaniness, the most memorable is Alberto Santos-Dumont, the Brazilian coffee heir and aviation nut who held aerial dinner parties (waiters had to be agile), and bar-hopped across fin de siècle Paris in a tiny airship. He later inspired Louis-François to pioneer wristwatches—previously a feminine accessory—for men. 

The jewels themselves are stupendous: gems the size of birds’ eggs, rope upon rope of perfectly matched pearls, [`whimsical`](  "A whimsical person or idea is unusual, playful, and unpredictable, rather than serious and practical. 异想天开的") creations such as the panthers that became synonymous with the Duchess of Windsor. Ms Cartier Brickell is alert to their diverse connotations, from love letter to grovelling apology to glaring status symbol. In occupied France, a brooch depicting a caged bird sat as a protest statement in Cartier’s flagship shop in Rue de la Paix. For all that, as many an exiled Romanov princess came to appreciate when forced to sell her purchases back to Cartier, a jewel is first and foremost a portable store of wealth. 

What took three generations to build was quickly dismantled by a fourth. Cartier passed from the founding dynasty’s hands in the 1960s and 1970s, but the jewellery created under the brothers still surfaces at royal weddings and auctions, where it often smashes reserve prices. (At Sotheby’s in London in 2010 Wallis Simpson’s panther bracelet became the world’s most expensive bangle.) It is tempting to look back on the firm’s heyday as a more graceful era; yet as Ms Cartier Brickell intimates, the only real difference between the excess-loving courtesan or scheming Gilded Age hostess who was the first owner of a Cartier bauble, and the reality-television star who snaps it up at auction, is an Instagram account. 

Not that the author dwells on the comparison; discretion is among the ways in which her meticulous, elegantly wrought narrative bears the Cartier hallmark. She is also kind to her subjects, a quality as beneficial in storytelling as Louis-François found it to be in business.

<h3 id="8.1">How migration makes the world brainier</h3>

MIGRATION SPREADS ideas. Often, good ones. Sometimes as simple as warm cassava buns `stuffed`<sup>塞满了的</sup> with cheese. 

Cristina Talacko moved to Australia because she married an Australian. Her foreign law degrees did not allow her to practise there so she started her own business. She noticed that her friends loved it when she served pão de queijo, a light, fluffy, buttery snack from her native Brazil. So she went back to Brazil and studied how to make the buns in bulk. She could not find the right machinery in Australia, so she imported it from Brazil and started selling what for Aussies was a novel (and gluten-free) treat. Business boomed. Now Ms Talacko exports tasty tucker to 25 countries. 

Everywhere, immigrants are likelier than the native-born to start their own business. People who pack up and fly thousands of miles to start a new life obviously have get-up-and-go. Also, many countries do not recognise foreign qualifications, as Ms Talacko found, so migrants often become entrepreneurs. A survey in 2015 found that the most common surnames for founders of new firms in Italy were Hu, Chen and Singh, with Rossi a distant fourth. 

The benefit for the host country is more than monetary. Yes, Ms Talacko employs Australians and pays a lot of tax. But she has also added a new snack to the Australian menu, making life down under just a tiny bit more joyful. 

Fully 29% of Australia’s population was born abroad. That is twice the proportion in the United States, the world’s best-known nation of immigrants. Until 1973, under what was known as the “white Australia” policy, immigration was largely restricted to people of European origin. Since then, the policy has been colour-blind and unusually welcoming, yet also ruthlessly selective. 

Applicants for “skilled independent” visas are given points for such things as education, work experience, English proficiency and, crucially, age. The ideal age is 25-32, when would-be migrants have finished college (possibly at another country’s expense) and have their whole working life ahead of them. The applicants with the most points are given permanent residency without even needing a job offer. Some say it would be better to give employers more say, but the system works well enough. 

Australia’s annual intake of permanent migrants has risen since the 1980s, from 69,000 in 1984-85 (including 14,000 refugees) to around 200,000 from 2011 to 2018 (including 10,000-20,000 refugees). In addition, the number of foreign students at Australian universities doubled, to 400,000, between 2008 and 2018, making higher education the country’s third-largest export. 

Oz has been transformed. Big cities are now conspicuously multi-ethnic. In Bankstown, a suburb of Sydney, Lebanese restaurants vie for space with Vietnamese money-transfer shops; 32,000 residents speak more than 60 languages at home. The inflow of brains from all around the world has made Australia richer and more dynamic. Since 1973 its population has doubled; its economy has grown 21-fold. The country has enjoyed 28 years of unbroken economic growth. 

Nearly two-thirds of skilled migrants move to America, Britain, Canada and Australia 

Australia exemplifies several trends. First, as an exceptionally desirable destination, it can recruit exceptional immigrants. It takes recruiting very seriously. Globally, the most skilled migrants are the most mobile. They face fewer barriers, because more places want them. They also travel farther. Whereas 80% of refugees and 50% of low-skilled migrants move to a neighbouring country, only 20% of highly skilled migrants do. Half of them travel more than 4,000km. 

They cluster in a few superstar destinations. Three-quarters of skilled migrants go to the ten most popular countries, and nearly two-thirds move to just four: America, Britain, Canada and Australia (see chart). All four are rich, English-speaking and have top-notch universities—a crucial draw. Three were founded on the notion that immigrants could go there and create a new life; the other, Britain, has a long, if chequered, tradition of cosmopolitan tolerance. Immigrants know they can become American, Canadian, Australian or British. Few imagine that they can become Chinese or Japanese, and becoming German is not easy either. 

Within the superstar destination countries, migrants head for a few megastar cities. There are more foreign-born residents in Melbourne or Los Angeles than in the whole of mainland China. The proportions of foreign-born in Toronto, Sydney, New York and London are 46%, 45%, 38% and 38% respectively. 

In these cities, brainy people from all around the world come together and bounce ideas off each other. Silicon Valley could not function without engineers from elsewhere. London’s financial industry would be lost without number-crunchers from Italy, India and Indiana. Immigrants or their children founded 45% of America’s Fortune 500 companies, including Apple, Google and Levi Strauss. Two-fifths of America’s Nobel science prize-winners since 2000 have been immigrants. Globally, migrants are three times likelier to file patents than non-migrants. 

Skilled migrants make locals more productive. Commercial or scientific projects typically involve big teams with varied talents and expertise. The absence of just one specialist can delay or scupper the whole project. Drawing on a global talent pool makes it easier to fill such gaps, and pursue bigger ideas. Startups that win visas for foreign staff in America’s skilled-visa lottery are more likely to expand, according to a study by Stephen Dimmock of Nanyang Technical University. This is one reason why, when Mr Trump squeezed the number of such visas, it did not create jobs for Americans. It forced American firms to move talent-hungry operations offshore, finds Britta Glennon of Carnegie Mellon University.

Immigrants bring new perspectives. They also bring knowledge of overseas markets, and connections. This speeds the flow of information between countries. Multinational firms that hire lots of skilled immigrants find it easier to do business with their home countries, says William Kerr of Harvard Business School. 

Sriraman Annaswamy, an Indian engineer who has settled in Australia, founded a multimillion-dollar consultancy to share his knowledge of the Indian analytics scene with Australian firms. He helps them tap the vast reservoir of talent in India. One client, a small machine-learning company, wanted 50 data scientists to help predict when water pipes needed to be fixed. A big telecoms firm needed analysts at short notice for a 2,000-person innovation centre. Neither could have found all that expertise in Australia. But Mr Annaswamy was able to find them Indian partners with the necessary brainpower. 

The most obvious benefits from migration are what economists call “static” gains—migrants from poorer to richer countries earn more the moment they arrive. “But the real gains are the dynamic ones,” says Caglar Ozden of the World Bank—the complex interplay of newcomers with natives and the outside world. “That is what created the US miracle [of the past two and a half centuries],” says Mr Ozden. It is also what has made Australia so rich. 

Not every Aussie is happy about mass immigration. Some are uncomfortable that their country is no longer solidly white. Plenty of Aboriginals are sorry that the white settlers came in the first place. But most grumbles about migrants are couched in non-racial terms. The most common gripes are that, as the population swells, cities become congested and homes become unaffordable. Another worry is geopolitical: that some Chinese migrants may be agents of influence for the dictatorship in Beijing. 

Mindful of such concerns, Australia’s conservative government has reduced the annual quota of permanent migrants (excluding refugees) from 190,000 to 160,000, starting this year. Still, public opinion remains robustly pro-immigration: 82% believe immigrants are good for Australia and 52% consider the current pace of immigration about right or too low, against 43% who want it reduced, a Scanlon Foundation poll finds. Many Aussies are fond of their South African dentist and would appreciate a plumber from absolutely anywhere. Anti-immigrant violence is rare. 

Australia’s unusually open immigration policy is underpinned by toughness. Successive governments have made it clear that Australia decides who can or cannot come. Those who try to migrate illegally are picked up at sea and, if no other country will take them, dumped in a camp on Nauru, a remote Pacific island. This policy is as cruel as it is controversial, but it has deterred irregular migrants from making the hazardous sea journey. And that makes it easier to win public `assent`<sup>同意</sup> for admitting lots of immigrants via the legal route. 

Allison Harell of the University of Quebec found that voters are more tolerant of immigration if they feel that their country is in control of its borders. This is easier for island-states like Australia and harder for those, such as the United States, that share a long land border with a developing country. When people think the government has lost control of its borders—as they did in Germany during the refugee crisis of 2015-16—they grow more hostile to migrants. Voters will support higher levels of immigration only if the process by which they are admitted is orderly and selective. They want to choose whom they let in—which is why footage of a “caravan” of thousands of Central Americans marching northwards and demanding to be let into the United States is probably a vote-winner for Mr Trump. 

A different worry is that if all rich countries copied Australia and poached the best foreign talent, poor countries would end up even poorer. It is immoral to cause a “brain drain”, goes the argument, because if all the doctors and engineers leave Liberia or Honduras, sick people there will die and bridges will fall down. 

This argument is too simplistic. Migrants send money home—a lot of it. An engineer who makes $7,000 a year in Zambia might make $70,000 in America and send back more than the entire amount he used to earn at home. 

Migrants also stay in touch with their home countries. Some spend a decade or two abroad, and then go back to start a business with the knowhow they have acquired in a more advanced country. That is, roughly speaking, how the Indian information-technology industry started. Mukesh Ambani, India’s richest industrialist, is a Stanford drop-out. Jack Ma, the founder of Alibaba, China’s biggest e-commerce firm, found out about the internet on a trip to America. A study by the Kauffman Foundation, a think-tank, found that two-thirds of Indian entrepreneurs who return home after working in America maintain at least monthly contact with former colleagues, swapping industry gossip and sharing ideas. 

What is more, the lure of earning big money overseas changes the incentives for people in poor countries. It prompts more of them to get educated and acquire marketable skills. Having acquired these skills, many who intended to emigrate never do, perhaps because they fall in love or their parents fall sick. Many who do emigrate, ultimately return. A study by Frédéric Docquier and Hillel Rapoport concluded that “high-skill emigration need not deplete a country’s human-capital stock”—and if well handled, can actually make the sending country richer. Big countries such as India, China and Brazil would benefit handsomely from sending out more migrants. However, once a country starts losing more than 20% of its university graduates, as some small African countries do, it starts to be a drag on growth.low of information between countries. Multinational firms that hire lots of skilled immigrants find it easier to do business with their home countries, says William Kerr of Harvard Business School. 

Sriraman Annaswamy, an Indian engineer who has settled in Australia, founded a multimillion-dollar consultancy to share his knowledge of the Indian analytics scene with Australian firms. He helps them tap the vast reservoir of talent in India. One client, a small machine-learning company, wanted 50 data scientists to help predict when water pipes needed to be fixed. A big telecoms firm needed analysts at short notice for a 2,000-person innovation centre. Neither could have found all that expertise in Australia. But Mr Annaswamy was able to find them Indian partners with the necessary brainpower. 

The most obvious benefits from migration are what economists call “static” gains—migrants from poorer to richer countries earn more the moment they arrive. “But the real gains are the dynamic ones,” says Caglar Ozden of the World Bank—the complex interplay of newcomers with natives and the outside world. “That is what created the US miracle [of the past two and a half centuries],” says Mr Ozden. It is also what has made Australia so rich. 

Not every Aussie is happy about mass immigration. Some are uncomfortable that their country is no longer solidly white. Plenty of Aboriginals are sorry that the white settlers came in the first place. But most grumbles about migrants are couched in non-racial terms. The most common gripes are that, as the population swells, cities become congested and homes become unaffordable. Another worry is geopolitical: that some Chinese migrants may be agents of influence for the dictatorship in Beijing. 

Mindful of such concerns, Australia’s conservative government has reduced the annual quota of permanent migrants (excluding refugees) from 190,000 to 160,000, starting this year. Still, public opinion remains robustly pro-immigration: 82% believe immigrants are good for Australia and 52% consider the current pace of immigration about right or too low, against 43% who want it reduced, a Scanlon Foundation poll finds. Many Aussies are fond of their South African dentist and would appreciate a plumber from absolutely anywhere. Anti-immigrant violence is rare. 

Australia’s unusually open immigration policy is underpinned by toughness. Successive governments have made it clear that Australia decides who can or cannot come. Those who try to migrate illegally are picked up at sea and, if no other country will take them, dumped in a camp on Nauru, a remote Pacific island. This policy is as cruel as it is controversial, but it has deterred irregular migrants from making the hazardous sea journey. And that makes it easier to win public `assent`<sup>同意</sup> for admitting lots of immigrants via the legal route. 

Allison Harell of the University of Quebec found that voters are more tolerant of immigration if they feel that their country is in control of its borders. This is easier for island-states like Australia and harder for those, such as the United States, that share a long land border with a developing country. When people think the government has lost control of its borders—as they did in Germany during the refugee crisis of 2015-16—they grow more hostile to migrants. Voters will support higher levels of immigration only if the process by which they are admitted is orderly and selective. They want to choose whom they let in—which is why footage of a “caravan” of thousands of Central Americans marching northwards and demanding to be let into the United States is probably a vote-winner for Mr Trump. 

A different worry is that if all rich countries copied Australia and poached the best foreign talent, poor countries would end up even poorer. It is immoral to cause a “brain drain”, goes the argument, because if all the doctors and engineers leave Liberia or Honduras, sick people there will die and bridges will fall down. 

This argument is too simplistic. Migrants send money home—a lot of it. An engineer who makes $7,000 a year in Zambia might make $70,000 in America and send back more than the entire amount he used to earn at home. 

Migrants also stay in touch with their home countries. Some spend a decade or two abroad, and then go back to start a business with the knowhow they have acquired in a more advanced country. That is, roughly speaking, how the Indian information-technology industry started. Mukesh Ambani, India’s richest industrialist, is a Stanford drop-out. Jack Ma, the founder of Alibaba, China’s biggest e-commerce firm, found out about the internet on a trip to America. A study by the Kauffman Foundation, a think-tank, found that two-thirds of Indian entrepreneurs who return home after working in America maintain at least monthly contact with former colleagues, swapping industry gossip and sharing ideas.

<h3 id="8.2">To make the world richer, let people move</h3>

UNDER A [`MAKESHIFT`](  "Makeshift things are temporary and usually of poor quality, but they are used because there is nothing better available. 临时凑合的") sunshade by a half-dry riverbed on the Indonesian island of Java, Eddie Sebastian is taking a lunch-break. It is hot and he is tired. He makes $2 a day collecting stones, breaking them with a hammer and selling them as building material. Asked if he has any better tools, he says: “Our most advanced equipment is that ‘forklift’.” He is pointing at a rusty [`wheelbarrow`](    "A wheelbarrow is a small open cart with one wheel and handles that is used for carrying things, for example, in the garden. (园艺用)手推车"). 

Mr Sebastian’s talents are wasted. Not just because he would make a fine stand-up comedian, but also because he was born in the wrong place. If he lived in a rich country, he would be operating a mechanical digger and earning $20 an hour instead of $2 a day. 

Migrants who move from lower- to higher-income countries typically earn three to six times more than they did at home, according to the World Bank. The simple act of moving makes them more productive, because rich countries have better institutions, the rule of law, efficient capital markets and modern companies. Construction workers in rich countries put up better buildings because they have better tools, reliable electricity and their employer does not have to pay off corrupt local officials. Scientists in rich countries make more breakthroughs because they have better laboratories and a wider selection of other scientists to work with. 

Small wonder so many of Mr Sebastian’s neighbours have migrated. A short walk up a hill from the quarry where he works is a village, Bumiayu, where the migrants’ homes are easy to spot. They are the fancy ones with multiple floors, big windows and satellite dishes. “This house belongs to a sailor,” says Idrus Dewi, a local fish farmer. “The owner of this house went to [South] Korea.” Mr Dewi is one of the lucky ones. His older sister is a nanny in Singapore. The money she sends home has paid her [`siblings`](  "Your siblings are your brothers and sisters. 兄弟姐妹")’ school fees and provided startup capital for a variety of family enterprises. 

If everyone who wanted to migrate were able to do so, global GDP would double, estimates Michael Clemens of the Centre for Global Development, author of a forthcoming book, “The Walls of Nations”. No other policy change comes close to generating such colossal rewards. If there is $90 trillion a year up for grabs, you might think that policymakers would be `feverishly`<sup>狂热地</sup> [`devising`](   "If you devise a plan, system, or machine, you have the idea for it and design it. 构思; 设计") ways to get a piece of it. They are not. 

In most rich countries immigration is political gelignite. Some of the biggest upheavals of the past decade—the election of Donald Trump, the rise of populism in Europe, Britain’s vote to leave the European Union—are partly driven by the fear of mass migration. Opponents of immigration everywhere make similar arguments: migrants are disruptive, strain public services, take jobs from locals and are often criminal. “I’m not a racist,” says Kevin Drake, a Brexit supporter in Essex, England. “But in school my grandkids don’t get attention because the foreigners can’t speak English and the teachers spend more time on them.” Immigration will “destroy Japan”, says Makoto Sakurai of the Japan First Party, which campaigns against Japan’s slight opening of its borders. 

Few migration-sceptics can cite concrete harm that a foreigner has done to them. But nationalists around the world constantly swap anecdotes, some of them true, that reinforce their fears. In the dozen countries your correspondent visited for this special report, he kept hearing the same handful of horror stories. “German women and girls as young as three are being raped by immigrants,” warned Mr Sakurai, who lives 9,000km from Germany. 

Exploiting and inflaming the fear of immigrants can win votes. Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orban, warns of a fictitious plot to swamp his Christian country with Muslims. Mr Trump reportedly wants an alligator moat to keep out Mexicans. Denmark has passed a law doubling the penalties for crimes in migrant “ghettos”. Immigrants are “electoral fuel”, says Andrea Costa, who runs a charity in Rome that helps them. 

The anti-immigrant bug has infected non-rich countries, too. In South Africa in September, at least 12 people were killed in riots aimed at migrants from the rest of Africa. India is building camps to intern some of the 2m people it recently stripped of citizenship. 

This special report will ask the big questions about migration. Who is moving, where and why? What are the effects on the places they move to, the ones they leave and the migrants themselves? It will look at cross-border movement and migration within countries. It will argue, perhaps unpopularly, that the world needs more migration; that the potential gains vastly outweigh the costs, and that those costs can be [`mitigated`](   "To mitigate something means to make it less unpleasant, serious, or painful. 缓解") with better policies. 

Migrants are far less numerous than news footage of overpacked boats suggests. The UN estimates that 270m people live outside the country where they were born (of whom 90% are economic migrants and the rest mostly refugees). That is 3.5% of humanity, a share barely higher than in 1960, though some countries have been more welcoming than others. 

It has become physically much easier to move, but bureaucratically much harder. Only 2% of those who arrived at Ellis Island a century ago were turned away. Now it is extremely difficult to migrate legally from a poor country to a rich one, unless you are highly skilled or a close relative of a legal resident. America’s green-card lottery last year attracted 294 applicants for each of its 50,000 slots. Partly because of Mr Trump’s efforts to make life hard for them, the net inflow of all migrants fell by 74% in 2018, to 200,000 people. Globally, many more people would like to move than can. A Gallup poll suggests that 750m people—15% of the world’s adults—want to settle permanently abroad. That includes 33% of sub-Saharan Africans and 27% of those in Latin America and the Caribbean. 

To explore the costs and benefits of migration, a good spot to start is the only place where one of the populists’ stereotypes—that immigrants are largely criminals—has ever been true: Australia.

<h3 id="8.3">When a worker migrates, a family benefits</h3>

THE ROAD to a better life is full of `pot-holes`<sup>坑槽</sup>. Fourteen years ago Listi Dewi, Idrus’s older sister, saw an advertisement for a job working in a restaurant. Her family needed money and the recruiter made golden promises. So she took a long bus ride from her village in central Java to a town near the Indonesian coast. 

It was not what she expected. Instead of starting work, she was locked in a dormitory surrounded by a fence and CCTV cameras. She was told she had to learn English, cookery and housework. She told herself that perhaps this was part of the training. 

After two months the recruiters revealed that she was going to be a maid in Singapore, a nearby island-state that is 15 times richer than Indonesia. If she refused, she would still owe them an impossibly large sum for her training and rent, they said. So she went. The agents took her first nine months’ pay to settle her “debt”. 

But then things began to look up. Her first employers in Singapore, a traffic cop and a telephone-company employee, were “very, very nice”, she says. For the second job, she cut out the [`unscrupulous`]( "If you describe a person as unscrupulous, you are critical of the fact that they are prepared to act in a dishonest or immoral way in order to get what they want. 不诚实的; 不道德的") middlemen and went straight to a Singaporean recruitment agency, which found her the first of a series of good employers. 

She now washes, cooks and cleans for two teachers, and looks after their children. The pay is good, she says: S$700 ($500) a month, plus bed and board in their comfortable flat with a shared swimming pool. Since she has few living expenses, she can save or send home most of her wages. 

The costs and benefits of low-skilled migration are complex. The migrants themselves benefit—otherwise they would not leave. Those who employ them benefit. Those who compete with migrants for jobs may not be so lucky. Some studies have found that unskilled migration drags down the wages of unskilled locals. But this effect is small, if it exists at all. George Borjas of Harvard, an immigration sceptic, finds that immigration reduces the incomes of native-born American high-school dropouts by 1.7%. Giovanni Peri, a pro-immigration economist, finds that it actually raises the wages of this same group by 0.6%. Both agree that for native workers as a whole, the effect on wages is mildly positive. 

That is partly because native-born workers can do things that newcomers cannot, such as speak the language fluently and navigate local institutions. When lots of low-skilled immigrants arrive and start doing manual jobs such as cooking, cleaning and building, the native-born often respond by moving into higher-status jobs, such as managing the migrant workers. 

Migrants often do jobs that natives [`shun`](   "If you shun someone or something, you deliberately avoid them or keep away from them. 有意回避"), such as picking fruit, dishing out parking tickets or caring for the elderly. This reduces what locals pay for fresh strawberries, orderly streets and nursing homes. Admitting an unskilled migrant can even increase the supply of skilled labour. Abundant foreign `nannies`<sup>保姆</sup> and cleaners make it more likely that college-educated native-born women will go out to work full-time—as Listi’s employers both do. 

Amandine Aubry of the OECD and others looked at all types of migration (skilled and unskilled) from developing countries to rich ones. They estimated that 83% of native-born workers benefited materially from it. They did so mostly as consumers, since migrants improved the variety, quality and price of goods and services on offer, from cheaper dry-cleaning to spicier meals. 

For the migrants themselves, the biggest cost of moving is often emotional. Leaving home means leaving behind family, friends and one’s own culture. For Listi, there is an extra cost. In Singapore foreigners who make more than S$6,000 a month are allowed to bring their families, but low-paid workers like her are not. 

So eager is the government to prevent maids from putting down roots or burdening public services that they are given regular health checks and, if found to be pregnant, sent home to give birth. Listi’s two children are back in Indonesia with relatives. “I used to cry every day because I missed my kids so much,” she says. “But now we use WhatsApp video to call a few times a week. Having connectivity makes it very different working overseas.” 

Others have it worse. Tati, another Indonesian maid, used to support a jobless husband with the wages she earned in the Gulf. When she returned for a visit, she discovered that he had not only found another woman but also sold their family home without her permission. “He says he spent the money on the kid. But I don’t believe it,” fumes Tati. She dumped him. 

The most obvious benefits for low-skilled economic migrants are, unsurprisingly, economic. When they move from a poor country to a rich one, their wages swiftly become a lot like those of similarly skilled workers in the place they have moved to, and nothing like those of their place of origin. Natural experiments show that this is not just because the kind of people who migrate are more ambitious. A study of Tongans who entered a random lottery to work in New Zealand found that those who won visas and moved earned nearly 300% more than those who did not—in the first year. 

[`Remittances`](    "A remittance is a sum of money that you send to someone. 汇款") to low- and middle income countries are three times greater than foreign aid 

Migrants typically share their gains with their families back home. Remittances to low- and middle-income countries reached a record high of $529bn in 2018, up nearly 10% from the previous year. In 2019 the World Bank predicts that remittances will be the largest source of external financing for such countries. They are already three times greater than foreign aid. And unlike donor funds, they tend to flow directly to the intended recipients, rather than being [`squandered`](    "If you squander money, resources, or opportunities, you waste them. 浪费 (金钱、资源或机会)") or [`embezzled`](    "If someone embezzles money that their organization or company has placed in their care, they take it and use it illegally for their own purposes. 挪用 (钱款)") by corrupt officials. 

For many countries they are a lifeline. Remittances are more than 10% of GDP in 28 countries, and even higher in Tonga (39%), Haiti (34%) and Tajikistan (30%). Remittance flows are more reliable than foreign investment. Indeed, they are helpfully countercyclical. When a crisis erupts, foreign investors flee. But migrants feel doubly compelled to help their relatives back home. 

Listi’s family sometimes went hungry before she went to Singapore. Now, thanks partly to the money she sends home, they are thriving. They have built a neat new home in Bumiayu, with a shop attached to the front selling noodles, spices, cigarettes, soap and other household goods. Visitors are treated to a heaped assortment of cakes made of rice, palm sugar and coconut flakes. As your correspondent is interviewing her siblings, Listi makes a video call from 1,100km away to chat with her eight-year-old son, and make sure he is doing his homework. 

For years Listi has paid the school fees for her 17-year-old sister Wanaziah, and helped other relatives. As soon as she turns 18, Wanaziah plans to migrate, too. She wants to work in an electronics factory in Japan. She has heard it is a prosperous, punctual, disciplined place. She likes the sound of that, though to her traditional Muslim ears the Japanese attitude to sex sounds frighteningly libertine. She worries about being lonely, but takes comfort in the fact that several of her schoolmates are also planning to go to Japan. She wants to work abroad for long enough to buy some land. Then she will come home and get married. 

Some migrants are exploited. Those who move illegally are especially vulnerable, since they often hire criminals to help them cross borders. Many Africans trying to reach Europe pass through Libya, because it is too lawless to stop them. Unfortunately, it is also too lawless to protect them from abuse. “I was jailed for six months in Libya for no reason,” says Ali, a Gabonese migrant now in Italy. “And the guards beat me with a metal pipe.” Other migrants have been kidnapped in Libya and auctioned to farmers as slaves. 

Domestic workers everywhere are vulnerable, since private homes are difficult places for labour inspectors to access. Some maids’ employers take their passports, fail to pay them agreed wages and even beat or rape them. But such things happen in their home countries, too. Indeed, the countries where forced labour is most common are the ones migrants strive hardest to leave. 

Migrants have found many ways to reduce the likelihood of being victimised. The most important is the mobile phone, which lets them swap information with friends who have already made the journey. In Bumiayu everyone knows how Listi was cheated when she first ventured abroad. But that is rare now, her family agree. Well-regulated local agencies place people in legal jobs overseas, and help with paperwork. The Indonesian embassy in Singapore circulates numbers for migrants to call if they are in danger. People have learned from Listi’s example. Idrus has a word for his pioneering sister. She is a pahlawan—a heroic warrior.

<h3 id="8.4">Why people should leave the countryside</h3>

IN WEICHENG, A village in Hebei province, a group of friends are tucking into duck, broccoli and dumplings, flavoured with raw `garlic`<sup>大蒜</sup> and `lubricated`<sup>润滑</sup> with baijiu liquor. It is the Chinese new year, and migrant workers have come home to see their families. Nationwide, some 3bn journeys were undertaken during the holiday season this year, making it the biggest mass migration ever; though next year’s will doubtless be even bigger. 

Suddenly a loud phone interrupts. Two men pop outside to take the call. When they come back, they both have new jobs: a three-month contract on a building site in Taiyuan, a city neither man has visited before. It pays 240 yuan ($34) a day, more than twice what they could make in the village. They were recruited by word of mouth—a former co-worker `vouched`<sup>担保</sup> that they were reliable. 

Weicheng village is not rich. Women break the ice on a river to hand-wash clothes. Toilets are holes in the ground. But villagers have motorbikes, televisions and plenty to eat. That is a huge blessing. Though no one dares talk about it, the elderly still remember mass starvation during the “Great Leap Forward” of 1958-61, when Mao Zedong forced peasants onto collective farms, where tens of millions died of hunger and disease. 

China is still a one-party state, but it owes much of its current prosperity to an increase in liberty. Since Mao died, his former subjects have won greater freedom to grow the crops they choose, to set up businesses and keep the profits, to own property, and to move around the country. The freedom to move, though far from absolute, has been transformational. Under Mao, peasants were banned from leaving their home area and, if they somehow made it to a city, they were barred from buying food, notes Bradley Gardner in “China’s Great Migration”. Now, there are more rural migrants in China than there are cross-border migrants in the world. 

By moving from unproductive `paddyfields`<sup>稻田</sup> to better jobs in factories and shops, they have made themselves and China richer. Somewhere between a fifth and a third of the country’s [`colossal`](    "If you describe something as colossal, you are emphasizing that it is very large. 巨大的") economic growth between the late 1970s and the current decade is due to this great migration. 

China’s population is now 60% urban, up from 18% in 1978. Sub-Saharan Africa is only 40% urban; India lags even further behind, at 34%. Mahatma Gandhi, modern India’s founding father, thought the growth of cities was “an evil thing, unfortunate for mankind and the world”. He believed that Indians would be spiritually more fulfilled if they stayed in villages, growing their own food and spinning their own clothes. 

Really? Five farmers in Gandhi’s home state of Gujarat showed your correspondent how much wheat they had harvested in three days, using hand-held sickles. A combine harvester could have done the job in a minute or two. 

The farmers are sharecroppers. They are always hungry at the start of the season, so the landlord advances them grain. Asked how much they currently owe him, they do not know: none of them can read or do sums. Asked how much they typically receive at the end of the year, they say “nothing”. The landlord always calculates that they have received their full share of the crop. He does not want them to have spare food or cash; if they did, they might quit. Aajeevika Bureau, a local charity, helps illiterate farm workers draw up contracts, and keeps copies on their behalf. But the quickest way to earn more is to move to a city. 

“In the city we have money,” says Ratansinh, who moved from rural Uttar Pradesh to Ahmedabad, the Gujarati commercial capital, when he was 18. “In the village we earned nothing. What we grew, we ate. What was left, we bartered for clothes and tools.” 

Now 52, he earns 24,000 rupees ($340) a month as a supervisor in a small textiles factory. The machines rattle loudly in the background as he talks. Like many Indian men who move to a city, he has left his family behind. His wife remains on the farm; his two children are at college. He goes back to the village for two months a year. He misses his wife, but “that’s the compromise you make. If I go back to the village, I can’t pay for my children’s education.” 

B.R. Ambedkar a `contemporary`<sup>同时代的人</sup> of Gandhi’s who `championed`<sup>支持</sup> dalits, called the Indian village “a den of ignorance, narrow-mindedness and communalism”. Many migrants agree. “In my village, cutting someone’s tree down by mistake could lead to murder,” recalls Tawwaj Ali, a factory worker in Ahmedabad. “No one knows who you are in the city,” he adds, “so there’s less conflict.” Indeed, strict rules about “untouchability” are impossible to enforce in a jam-packed Mumbai train, notes Chinmay Tumbe of the Indian Institute of Management in Ahmedabad, author of “India Moving”. 

In rich countries 81% of people live in urban areas. Mechanised farms produce enough food for all, while leaving plenty of space for parks and wilderness. In the rest of the world half the population still lives in the countryside. Many politicians, like Gandhi, think they should stay there, either for romantic reasons (the countryside is so beautiful!) or because they do not want peasants building [`unsightly`](    "If you describe something as unsightly, you mean that it is ugly. 难看的") slums in their cities. 

Under China’s hukou (household registration) system, rural migrants who work in top-tier cities are treated as second-class citizens. The aim is to discourage them from settling there. They are barred from urban public services, and so must either leave their kids with grandma in the village or scrape together the cash to put them in shoddy urban private schools. Sometimes city authorities bulldoze these schools. The hukou system is one reason why rural Chinese children are dramatically worse educated than urban ones—and two-thirds of Chinese children are officially rural. 

Several people from Weicheng village work in Beijing. This means separation. “It would be impossible to get our kids into a public school there,” sighs a mother who looks after them in the village while her husband is away. 

In India the obstacles to internal migration are more subtle. One is language—India has more than 100 of them. Another is the difficulty of obtaining government benefits after crossing a state line. A study by Zovanga Kone of Oxford University and others finds that migration between neighbouring Indian districts is 50% higher if they are in the same state than if they are separated by a state border. 

Another problem is violence. Rape is common and poorly policed. So although many Indian women migrate to marry, few migrate to work (unlike in China). And because most migrant workers are men, the places where they cluster have wildly unbalanced sex ratios, making them even more dangerous for women. 

Babu Gamar, a farmer in Gujarat, says that half the men in his village go away to work. But “young women can’t go—they might be abused,” he says. Virjibhai Gamar, a neighbour, concurs. Every month he goes with his brothers to work on building sites. Their wives and sisters do not join them. 

The distorted sex ratio of Indian migrants helps `demographers`<sup>人口统计学家</sup> track trends that would otherwise be hard to measure. In areas that send a lot of migrants to cities, the working-age population is heavily female, but the elderly population is not, notes Mr Tumbe. That implies that rural migrants eventually go back home. Many `scrimp`<sup>吝啬</sup> in the city, often sleeping four to a room, so they can buy land in their village. 

In “Good Economics for Hard Times”, Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo, two of the winners of this year’s Nobel prize for economics, argue that most people who would benefit from moving stay put, for three reasons. They value the familiar; they overestimate the risks of moving; and they do not know anyone or have anywhere to stay in the place they could go. 

Mr Banerjee and Ms Duflo suggest giving poor people small amounts of cash and some information. A charity in northern Bangladesh tried this. Some villagers were randomly selected and told how much higher wages were in a city. Others were given the same information plus $11.50 in cash—roughly the cost of a bus fare and two days’ food—but only if they went to work in the city. 

The villagers who were given information only were no likelier to migrate. But the combination of cash and nudge prompted 22% of households who would not otherwise have sent out a migrant to do so. And the families who sent out a migrant saw their daily intake of calories shoot up from 1,400 a head to 2,200; that is, from the edge of starvation to tolerable comfort. Mobility fills bellies. 

In rich countries internal migration is seldom a matter of life or death. But many people could earn more if they moved from stagnant towns to thriving ones. Hull’s jobless could easily find work in London. Alas, they will struggle to find a place to live. Rents are extortionate in the cities people most want to move to. NIMBYs block any structure that might mar their view. Red tape can make property several times more expensive than it need be, forcing potential migrants to stay where rents are cheap. Americans are barely half as likely to move to a different county as they were in the 1950s. And this means their talents are often wasted. Chang-Tai Hsieh of the University of Chicago and Enrico Moretti of the University of California, Berkeley estimate that artificial restrictions on housing supply knocked 36% off America’s aggregate GDP growth between 1964 and 2009. 

Because moving disrupts a previous way of life, it forces the mover to try new things. Mr Banerjee and Ms Duflo describe a natural experiment that took place when a volcanic eruption in 1973 destroyed a third of the houses on the Westaman islands, off the coast of Iceland. The lava struck randomly. Before the eruption, there was no significant difference between the people who lost homes and those who did not. But afterwards, the ones whose homes were destroyed were more likely to leave the islands, by 42% to 26%. (They were compensated for their loss, but did not have to spend the money on rebuilding their old home.) 

Researchers traced the islanders’ progress. They found that, for those who were under 25 at the time of the eruption, losing a house led to large material gains. “By 2014 those whose (parental) houses were destroyed earned over $3,000 per year more than those whose (parental) houses were not destroyed.” The gains came from moving: those who upped sticks made $25,000 a year more than those who did not. They were more likely to go to college, and to find a job that matched their intellect and aptitude, rather than following the islands’ default career of catching fish and getting by. Generations of parents have threatened to “light a fire” under their [`shiftless`](    "If you describe someone as shiftless, you mean that they are lazy and have no desire to achieve anything. 懒惰且不求上进") offspring. It turns out that’s not a bad idea.

<h3 id="8.5">Why the arguments against immigration are so popular</h3>

TO UNDERSTAND WHY people oppose immigration, it is worth visiting Tilbury, a port town outside London. Thurrock, the local parliamentary constituency, is 81% white British. Many residents moved here from London as the capital filled with migrants and house prices soared. London’s white-British population fell from 60% to 45% in a single decade, between 2001 and 2011. Some whites moved out because they sold their flats for tidy sums and bought nicer homes with gardens farther from the centre. Others did not like being a minority in the city where they grew up. 

During the Brexit-referendum campaign in 2016, Brexiteers argued that leaving the European Union was the only way for Britain to regain control of its borders. A whopping 72% of voters in Thurrock voted to leave. Most do not hate foreigners, but many feel beleaguered and disrespected. “We’re English, not British. If you say you’re English apparently you’re a racist,” says Trish Byne, who runs a tattoo and piercing shop in Tilbury with her husband, Tony. “In the UK, [`indigenous`](   "Indigenous people or things belong to the country in which they are found, rather than coming there or being brought there from another country. 本土的; 当地的") people are ignored,” says Tony. “The rights of minorities take [`precedence`](   "If one thing takes precedence over another, it is regarded as more important than the other thing. 优先性").” 

“We’re in favour of immigration, but controlled immigration,” says Trish. She wants immigrants to integrate, but fears that many try “to impose their cultures and language and religion”. She mentions no personal experiences of harm, but says: “In London, I’ve seen videos on YouTube of streets where English people cannot go because there is sharia law.” She adds, of refugees: “You don’t know what boat people have got in their backpacks, it could be terrorist weaponry. That is not me living in la-la land; that is what I’ve heard from people working on the docks.” 

Thoughtful writers such as Paul Collier and David Goodhart argue that if too many migrants arrive too quickly, it disrupts communities and inflicts unwelcome cultural change on the natives. Mr Goodhart complains that liberal politicians attach too little weight to the views of people who like things the way they were. This argument should be taken seriously—for some people, any kind of cultural change feels like a threat. The old find it hardest to adapt. “I was born here and it was a lovely village. Now it’s a concrete jungle and you can’t even hear people speaking English—it’s awful,” says Ann Hoyle, 76. But many of the things that voters fear about migrants are not true, and some of their objections can be answered, up to a point, with smarter policies. 

Whatever Trish may have seen online, there are no streets in London where the native-born cannot go. Islamist terrorism is a worry, but should be seen in perspective. Terrorists killed six people a year in Britain in the decade to 2017. A Brit is eight times likelier to be struck by lightning (though only half as likely to die from it). Young male native-born Brits and Americans are more likely to commit ordinary violent crimes than young male immigrants. 

In all rich democracies, locals grumble that immigrants drain the welfare state. “If I go to the doctor, I have to pay for it. Foreigners come and they get childbirth and operations all paid for. They should be made to pay, too. If they can’t, send them packing,” says Joan Smith, a 73-year-old in Tilbury. Again, this is not an accurate picture. Migrants pay taxes. In countries with flexible labour markets and thrifty welfare states, such as America and Britain, they generally pay their way, unlike the native-born. Over a lifetime, a typical migrant from Europe to Britain can expect to pay £78,000 more in taxes than he receives in benefits. 

Immigrants are a burden only if a host country’s policies set them up to be one, by making it too easy to draw benefits or too hard to work. Sweden committed both these errors with asylum-seekers during the European migrant crisis in 2015-16, showering them with free stuff while forcing them to remain idle for long periods. This was not sustainable, and the government `curbed`<sup>约束</sup> the flow of refugees by five-sixths. 

The simplest way to make sure that migrants do not abuse any given benefit is to make them [`ineligible`](  "If you are ineligible for something, you are not qualified for it or entitled to it. 不合格的; 无资格的") for it, for five or ten years or permanently. “Build a wall around the welfare state, not around the country,” urged the late William Niskanen, an economist. In the United Arab Emirates, where migrants have no access to state benefits and no chance of citizenship, citizens do not seem to mind being outnumbered nine to one by foreign workers. 

Another fear, that migrants will steal jobs from locals, is as widespread as it seems logical. “Migrants in construction are much better workers than the English, who show up late and leave early,” says Danny Proctor, who manages building projects in Tilbury. “Foreigners aren’t lazy like that. I have a lot of plasterers from Lithuania and Poland. For 20 years they’ve been the best workers.” An English plasterer listening to Mr Proctor might despair. But the supply of jobs is not fixed. Migrants spend money as well as earning it, thus creating more demand for other people’s labour. Immigration slightly raises the wages of most native workers. The relatively small number of losers could be compensated out of the vastly larger gains that [`accrue`](    "If money or interest accrues, it gradually increases in amount over a period of time. 累积 (过程)") to the immigrants themselves. 

The World Bank recommends that governments replace visa quotas with taxes to regulate immigration flows. They could do so via a surtax on immigrants’ incomes, or other means. They could earmark the proceeds for a popular cause, such as pensions or health care, or remit the cash directly to citizens. The more migrants they admit, the bigger the payout. This might make the native-born see immigration as less of a threat and more of an opportunity. 

William Bourke of Sustainable Australia, a party that campaigns to reduce immigration, argues that letting in too many newcomers leads to overcrowding, `congestion`<sup>拥挤</sup>, high house prices and environmental stress. “As people move from the developing world to the rich one, they move from a low carbon footprint to a high one.” 

The notion that Australia is overcrowded seems absurd. The empty plains of North Dakota are three times more densely populated. But migration in the rich world is highly concentrated. Newcomers head for the most dynamic cities, where everyone else wants to live, too. Congestion and high house prices are big problems in places like Sydney and London, but they can be eased by better policies. Restrictive zoning rules do more to inflate house prices than immigration does. Cities would accommodate many more people if they could build upwards. And immigrants’ taxes could cover the cost of the extra roads and subway lines needed. 

The impact of migration on climate change is probably small. Migrants who escape poverty might emit more carbon, but it is grotesque to argue that they should therefore remain poor. And there are two counter-arguments. First, migration stimulates scientific research, which will help curb global warming. An Indian in North America is 28,000 times more likely to file a patent than in India. 

Second, migration causes fertility to plunge. Migrants from poor countries to rich ones no longer want seven children. They want their kids to go to college, so they have small families. Ethnic Somali women have an average of 6.2 kids in Somalia but only 2.4 in Norway. Allowing more migration to rich countries would reduce the future global population, making environmental problems easier to tackle in the long run. 

Some opponents of immigration fret that it will increase inequality. Some think it unjust that people from poor places might come to rich ones to work as servants. But if the migrants thought that, they would not come. Workers from a poor country who start at the bottom in a rich one will, statistically, make their new home more unequal. But their moving will reduce global inequality. 

A deeper worry is that mass migration might undermine the traits that make the rich world rich, such as good institutions and the rule of law. Many migrants come from countries with terrible, crooked governments. Suppose enough of them arrived to replace the norms of, say, Japan with those of Haiti? 

Immigration sceptics cite many alarming anecdotes. Mexican mobsters sell drugs in America. A gang of Pakistani-British men sexually abused hundreds of young white girls in Yorkshire. The Chinese government `snoops`<sup>窥探</sup> on Chinese overseas students to make sure they say nothing heretical about democracy or Taiwan. 

But step back and a more hopeful picture emerges. America’s population has risen 60-fold since 1800. It has absorbed migrants from Tsarist Russia, Hitler’s Germany, Ho Chi Minh’s Vietnam and nearly every other dictatorship of the past 200 years, without losing its democratic soul. On the contrary, migrants head to America because they prefer its institutions to the ones back home. 

By most measures, immigrants in the United States are integrating as well as ever. Their unemployment rate is a negligible 3.5%, lower than for the native-born. Only half of first-generation immigrants speak English “very well”, but by the second generation English dominates even among Hispanics, who are surrounded by other Spanish-speakers. Only 6% of second-generation Hispanic immigrants speak mostly Spanish. By the fourth generation, half of those with Hispanic `forebears`<sup>祖先</sup> are so well integrated that they no longer identify as Hispanic. 

America’s success in absorbing immigrants is remarkable, but in recent decades it has been surpassed. The share of the population who are foreign-born is higher in Australia (29%), New Zealand (24%) and Canada (21%) than in the United States (14%). None of these new migrant magnets has a perfect immigration system. But all combine openness with order, selecting the migrants they want, processing their visas reasonably quickly and excluding unauthorised migrants fairly effectively. 

Australia shows that a well-run democracy can be twice as open to immigrants as America and still rank ten places higher on the UN’s Human Development Index. Singapore, where 45% of residents are foreign-born, shows that a well-run city-state can be more open still. It would be `rash`<sup>轻率地</sup> to open the gates suddenly and completely. But countries could open a bit and see how it goes.

<h3 id="8.6">Why voting with your feet is more effective than a ballot</h3>

WHEN A VOTER casts a ballot, his choice is unlikely to affect his life. If he votes with his feet, there is a good chance he will change his life dramatically, observes Ilya Somin of George Mason University, author of a forthcoming book, “Free to Move”. Consider Edinson Infante, a Venezuelan who makes handbags out of banknotes, folded and glued together. A single lipstick placed in one of his bags is worth far more than the stack of Bolivars from which it was made. That is why Mr Infante emigrated. 

He could not make a living in Venezuela, a socialist `dictatorship`<sup>专政</sup>. So he moved to Colombia, the reasonably well-run country next door, where he sells his art on the streets. He now earns enough to pay rent, eat properly and send groceries home to his mother. He says he feels free in Colombia. He can stroll without feeling scared, and afford occasional treats like caramel sweets. 

Since 2014, 4.6m Venezuelans have voted with their feet against the violent, corrupt regime of Nicolás Maduro—a seventh of the population. In a country where elections are [`rigged`]( "If someone rigs an election, a job appointment, or a game, they dishonestly arrange it to get the result they want or to give someone an unfair advantage. (欺骗性地) 幕后操纵"), the only way they can get a better government is to go and find one. 

Foot-voting can take place over any distance and for many reasons. A person may move from Congo to Botswana to be better governed, or from New York to Florida for a lower tax bill and kinder weather. Foot-voters are typically better informed than ballot-casters. One vote is unlikely to affect an election result, so hours spent analysing each candidate’s policies are probably wasted. When migrating, by contrast, an informed choice pays huge dividends and an ignorant one can spell disaster. 

If people were allowed to vote freely with their feet, they would have more choices about the kind of society in which they lived. A gay man might choose to leave Iran, where his love is punishable by death, and move to Uruguay, where he could get married. A traditional Saudi man might choose to remain in Saudi Arabia, where Islamic piety is enforced and women are kept in their place. His wives might prefer to move to Canada, where they would be free to divorce him. The biggest gains from foot-voting often accrue to ill-treated groups such as ethnic and sexual minorities, and women. 

The lengths to which people will go to vote with their feet give a hint of how large the benefits can be. Emmanuel, for example, left Gabon because it fails to protect young women like her from sexual violence. Her father used to abuse her. When her mother found out, she blamed Emmanuel, beat her, threw her clothes into the street and ordered her out of the house. 

It is hard enough reporting a sex crime in a rich democracy, where the police are trained to treat [`allegations`]( "An allegation is a statement saying that someone has done something wrong. 指控") sensitively. In Gabon the cops are as scary as the criminals. Emmanuel saw no chance of justice, so when a friend offered her a plane ticket to Turkey, she went. From there, heavily pregnant, she boarded a flimsy boat bound for Greece. It leaked, and began to sink. She fell into the freezing water. Her friends called the coastguard, who found her after 45 minutes. Amazingly, both she and her baby survived. Now in Athens, she helps out at Melissa Network, a refugee charity, and hopes to train as a medical secretary. She says she feels much safer in Greece: “You have human rights here.” 

A worry about foot-voting is that it might [`retard`](  "If something retards a process, or the development of something, it makes it happen more slowly. 阻碍; 减缓") reform in the places migrants leave. If the strongest objectors to Venezuela’s dictatorship have gone, who will stand up to it? It is a reasonable fear. When ethnic minorities flee to escape mistreatment, their departure may indeed reward their tormentors. For example, a politician may court the votes of his own tribe by stirring up [`animosity`](    "Animosity is a strong feeling of dislike and anger. Animosities are feelings of this kind. 强烈敌意") against another, thus spurring the out-group to leave his electoral district and making it easier for him to win re-election. 

However, foot-voting can also accelerate reform. Dissidents often find safety abroad. Exiles played a big role in ending apartheid in South Africa, and today are the most audible critics of authoritarian regimes in China and North Korea. Even the possibility of exit can influence how societies are run. If taxpayers can move, governments must govern better to avoid losing them. When the citizens of the closed, communist states of eastern Europe were allowed to head west and sample the fruits of capitalism in the late 1980s, the Soviet empire was revealed to be a failure, and collapsed. Migrants often stimulate reform at home by finding good ideas overseas and bringing or sending them back. India’s successful economic opening in the 1990s was informed by the observation that Indians were [`prospering`](    "If people or businesses prosper, they are successful and do well. 兴隆; 成功") everywhere except in India. 

The arguments for allowing more freedom to move are partly economic. Migrants from poor to rich countries could collectively increase their incomes by tens of trillions of dollars. For this opportunity, they would surely be willing to share some of the benefits with the rich-country voters who let them in. Since the economic disruption caused by migration is modest, an imaginative government with sensible policies (come to work, do not draw welfare) could raise living standards all round. 

But that is only half the story. Liberal, democratic capitalist societies have many flaws, but also great virtues: peace, freedom, tolerance and a culture that fosters innovation. The simplest way to spread these virtues is to let more people in. Every time a migrant flees a dictatorship for a democracy, global freedom grows a little. Every time someone leaves a kleptocracy for a more law-abiding state, humanity is slightly better governed. Every time a woman leaves a country where her testimony is worth less than a man’s, global sexism `ebbs`<sup>衰退</sup> a millimetre or two. Migration is, therefore, a deeply moral issue. 

Rich countries have a choice. They are ageing. Without immigration, their populations will soon start to shrink, if they have not started already. They can choose to dwindle gradually into comfortable obscurity. Or they can confidently recruit talent from everywhere, inviting bright minds and willing hands to help build a bigger Australia, a bigger America or even a bigger Japan. 

The more the West opens its doors, the richer and more powerful it will be in 50 years. Indeed, as the world’s population stabilises and falls, each country’s weight in the world will depend more and more on whether people want to live there. This is one of the biggest advantages that rich democracies have over nationalist dictatorships such as China. On current trends, most will [`squander`](    "If you squander money, resources, or opportunities, you waste them. 浪费 (金钱、资源或机会)") it. 

Potential migrants watch the news. The brightest have choices, and will shun places they think might mistreat them. Already, brainy Chinese are wondering whether they will be welcome in America, which is one reason why the number of new foreign students there fell by 7% in 2017-18. Brainy Indians are tiring of the `interminable`<sup>无止尽的</sup> wait for a green card. Some give up and go elsewhere. 

Uma Kanekar, a high-flying Indian IT specialist, moved to Canada after a decade in the United States waiting vainly for a green card. The last straw was the realisation that her daughter Disha, a college student who had lived in New Jersey since she was six, might be sent back to India when she turned 21 and was no longer covered by her mother’s temporary work visa. Canada gave the family permanent residence in eight months. “It’s so nice to be in a country where you feel you belong,” says Disha. 

For all the furious `demagoguery`<sup>散布谣言</sup> around migration, there is hope. Despite (or perhaps because of) Mr Trump, more Americans today say immigration should be increased than say it should be cut, finds a Pew poll. Majorities in Spain, Canada and Japan support keeping migrant flows the same or raising them. Most Greeks, Italians and Russians do not. So be it. Countries can have different policies. Many will build walls. If they fail to put well-designed doors in them, they will end up poorer, weaker and duller.
