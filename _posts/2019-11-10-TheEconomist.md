<h3 id="1.1">A century ago America saved millions of Russians from starvation</h3>
The Russian Job. By Douglas Smith.Farrar, Straus and Giroux; 320 pages; $28. Picador; £25. 

TO MOST PEOPLE shaped by the cold war—and today’s icy relations—Russia and America may seem always to have been [`sworn`](  "If two people or two groups of people are sworn enemies, they dislike each other very much. 不共戴天的")<sup>发过誓的</sup> enemies. When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991 America celebrated victory. When Vladimir Putin set out to avenge history and make Russia great again, he whipped up anti-American [`hysteria`](  "Hysteria among a group of people is a state of uncontrolled excitement, anger, or panic. 歇斯底里")<sup>歇斯底里</sup> and scorned Washington’s overreach. For his part, Donald Trump—who thinks America has in the past been a soft touch—in effect [`concurred`](    "If one person concurs with another person, the two people agree. You can also say that two people concur. 意见一致")<sup>一致</sup> with Mr Putin’s criticism, pledging to put narrow American interests first. 

In recounting America’s biggest ever humanitarian effort—to save millions of lives in the [`nascent`](  "Nascent things or processes are just beginning, and are expected to become stronger or to grow bigger. 新生的; 初期的")<sup>初期的</sup> Soviet state a century ago—“The Russian Job” by Douglas Smith repudiates the modern mythologies of both countries, and their leaders’ twisted histories. Already ravaged by wars and revolution, in 1920-22 Russia was hit by [`droughts`](   "A drought is a long period of time during which no rain falls. 干旱")<sup>干旱</sup> and faced one of Europe’s worst ever famines. It was partly self-induced: terrorised by the Red Army and threatened with requisitions and executions, Russian peasants drastically reduced the land under cultivation, sowing the minimum required for their own survival. 

[`Acutely`](    "If you feel or notice something acutely, you feel or notice it very strongly. 强烈地")<sup>强烈地</sup> aware that food meant power, Vladimir Lenin abandoned War Communism in favour of a new economic policy that replaced requisition with taxes and made some concession to capitalism. But it was too late. By the end of 1921, the vast territory along the Volga [`succumbed`]( "If you succumb to temptation or pressure, you do something that you want to do, or that other people want you to do, although you feel it might be wrong. (向诱惑、压力) 屈服")<sup>屈服</sup> to [`starvation`](  "Starvation is extreme suffering or death, caused by lack of food. 饥饿; 饿死")<sup>饿死</sup> and [`cannibalism`]( "If a group of people practise cannibalism, they eat the flesh of other people. 同类相食")<sup>食人</sup> 

Having come to power on the promise to provide bread and end war, the Bolsheviks confronted the prospect of being swept away by hunger. Unable to feed their own people, the leaders of the [`proletarian`](    "Proletarian means relating to the proletariat. 无产阶级的")<sup>无产阶级的</sup> revolution turned to the West for help. Maxim Gorky, a Bolshevik writer who had once `demonised`<sup>使成为魔鬼</sup> American capitalism, appealed to “all honest European and American people” to “give bread and medicine”. 

The appeal struck a chord with Herbert Hoover, founding chief of the American Relief Administration (ARA). The future president responded not out of sympathy for the “murderous tyranny” of the Bolshevik regime, but from faith in America’s mission—and ability—to improve the world. If children were starving, America was obliged to ease their suffering. “We must make some distinction between the Russian people and the group who have seized the government,” Hoover argued. 

The ARA’s insistence on complete autonomy made the Soviet government suspicious, as did its pledge to help without regard to “race, creed or social status”. After all, the regime had `liquidated`<sup>清算</sup> entire classes of citizens and nationalised not only private property but human life. Still, given a choice between losing face or losing the country, the Bolsheviks conceded the ARA’s conditions—while putting the operation under surveillance by the secret police. 

Mr Smith’s book is not a political history, however. It is principally a reconstruction of the lives of those ARA men, many from military backgrounds, who over two and a half years in effect took over the functions of civil government in Russia, feeding some 10m people. In the Volga region, where residents were driven by hunger to boil and eat human flesh, the ARA organised kitchens and transport, distributed food and rebuilt hospitals. 

The misery they encountered in Russia strained their nerves to the point of breakdown and despair, but also [`imbued`]( "If someone or something is imbued with an idea, feeling, or quality, they become filled with it. 灌输; 使充满")<sup>灌溉</sup> their careers with meaning. “It is only by being of service that one can be happy,” an ARA officer wrote. “The help given by the Americans can never be forgotten, and the story of their glorious exploit will be toldby grandfathers to their grandchildren,” grateful Russians told them. 

Yet the [`duplicity`](  "If you accuse someone of duplicity, you mean that they are deceitful. 奸诈")<sup>口是心非</sup> and [`paranoia`](  "If you say that someone suffers from paranoia, you think that they are too suspicious and afraid of other people. 多疑; 恐惧")<sup>偏执狂</sup> of the Soviet government haunted the ARA’s operation to the very end. While publicly Bolshevik leaders showered the Americans with praise and thanks, the secret police instructed local officials: “Under no circumstances are there to be any large displays or expressions of gratitude made in the name of the people.” No sooner was the Russian job done than the authorities began to [`expunge`](  "If you expunge something, you get rid of it completely, because it causes problems or bad feelings. 清除; 抹去")<sup>擦去</sup> all memory of America’s help. 

The edition of the Great Soviet Encyclopedia of 1950 described the ARA as a front “for spying and wrecking activities and for supporting counter-revolutionary elements”. Modern Russian textbooks barely mention the episode. But it is not just Russia that needs to be reminded of this story—so does America, which derived much of its 20th-century greatness from its values rather than military power. As Gorky told Hoover: “The generosity of the American people `resuscitates`<sup>复兴</sup> the dream of `fraternity`<sup>友谊</sup> among people at a time when humanity needs charity and compassion.”

<h3 id="1.2">An imperial palace, a prison—and now a symbolic museum</h3>
THE STAIRS rise elegantly, twisting towards the heavens. At the top is the small room where Emperor Menelik II prayed for God’s blessing as he dramatically enlarged Ethiopia’s territory in the last decades of the 19th century. The watchtower, as this wing of the palace is known, was also a perfect vantage point for surveying his subjects on the open plain beneath its windows. It was here that Menelik founded Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital, in 1886. The grand palace he built on a hilltop became the heart of each regime that succeeded his, through wars and revolutions. 

Now it is to be a symbol for a new era. Last month, after winning the Nobel peace prize, Abiy Ahmed, Ethiopia’s prime minister, opened the old palace to the public for the first time since the [`aftermath`]( "The aftermath of an important event, especially a harmful one, is the situation that results from it. (灾难性大事件的) 后果")<sup>后果</sup> of the revolution that overthrew Emperor Haile Selassie in 1974. At a cost of $170m (paid by the United Arab Emirates, a close ally), it is by far the country’s glitziest museum. As well as the palace itself, the site has state-of-the-art galleries that narrate Ethiopian history; a [`botanical`]( "Botanical books, research, and activities relate to the scientific study of plants. 植物学的")<sup>植物学的</sup> garden; a pavilion with exhibits on the country’s nine regions; and two black-maned Abyssinian lions [`dozing`]( "When you doze, you sleep lightly or for a short period, especially during the daytime. 打盹儿")<sup>打盹儿</sup> in a den. “In all Ethiopian history, wherever there is a palace there must be a lion,” explains Abebaw Ayelaw, the curator. 

Unity Park, as the attraction is known, has already received more than 17,000 visitors. “Let God bless you,” gushes a middle-aged woman to Tamrat Haile, the museum’s overall boss, as she emerges from an `ornately`<sup>装饰过分地</sup> decorated banquet hall. Inside is a `waxwork`<sup>蜡像</sup> model of Menelik sitting on his original throne; some visitors prostrate themselves in [`deference`](   "Deference is a polite and respectful attitude toward someone, especially because they have an important position. 敬重")<sup>尊重</sup>. The passions excited by the museum `testify`<sup>作证</sup> to the power of Ethiopia’s past both to inspire and divide. For the country’s current rulers, reconfiguring its heritage is a means to confer legitimacy and foster national unity, at a time when both are in question. 

Abiy has put the renovation and celebration of historical sites at the centre of his politics. “Our job is to shake the dust off Ethiopia,” he maintained in a documentary about Unity Park broadcast on state television in September. Nearby Jubilee Palace, built by Haile Selassie in the 1950s, is also being rehabilitated (with French funds) and will eventually open to the public. Another new museum in Addis Ababa will commemorate Menelik’s defeat of the invading Italians in 1896; at least four more royal palaces in smaller towns are to become museums, too. Two ancient Christian sites, in the highland towns of Axum and Lalibela, are undergoing restoration. 

Unity Park emphasises ordered progress over violent rupture. On a wall outside the palace hang portraits of every Ethiopian leader from Menelik to Abiy’s predecessor, Hailemariam Desalegn. A gallery inside the classical-style throne hall, where there is a waxwork of Haile Selassie (pictured), outlines the contributions of each to the country’s development. Menelik’s successor, Lij Iyasu, is noted for his role in establishing the first police force. Mengistu Haile Mariam, the bloodstained [`dictator`](  "A dictator is a ruler who has complete power in a country, especially power which was obtained by force and is used unfairly or cruelly. 独裁者")<sup>独裁者</sup> of the 1970s and 1980s, is praised for defending Ethiopia from the invading Somalis—though an excellent exhibition in the palace’s basement, dedicated to those who were imprisoned there during the revolution Mengistu led, helps balance the picture of him. 

The current prime minister, who took office in 2018 and promises Ethiopia’s first free election next May, presents all this as a break with the past. “Previously, when a government changed it would remove all the marks of its predecessor,” comments Abebaw, the curator. When Mengistu’s communist junta, known as the Derg, seized power in 1974, imperial statues were torn down. Some were dumped in the garden of the National Museum, where they still lie; others were destroyed. Elias Wondimu, a publisher who has opened a shop in Unity Park, remembers buying coffee beans wrapped in pages torn from history books. Shiferaw Bekele, a historian, recalls bonfires of books that included Haile Selassie’s autobiography. The revolutionary fervour was so intense that even the royal lions were killed. 

When the Derg itself was overthrown in 1991, the incoming Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) followed suit. Unsurprisingly, a statue of Lenin was `toppled`<sup>倒下</sup>. But imperial heritage was also in the firing line. “There was a very organised, systematic attempt to destroy the image of Menelik,” says Shiferaw. A [`controversy`](   "Controversy is a lot of discussion and argument about something, often involving strong feelings of anger or disapproval. 论战")<sup>辩论</sup> about the fate of his statue in Addis Ababa triggered large protests in its defence. The monument survived, but remains a source of tension. 

The decision to turn Menelik’s palace into a museum is even more [`contentious`](   "A contentious issue causes a lot of disagreement or arguments. 引起争议的")<sup>有异议的</sup>. Several bigwigs from Abiy’s ethnic group, the Oromo, snubbed the inauguration and instead visited a memorial to Oromo victims of the emperor’s military campaigns. His armies committed mass atrocities, they say, so he should not be celebrated. 

At the bottom of this heritage drive is a highly charged question: is Ethiopia an old nation or the product of a [`rapacious`]( "If you describe a person or their behaviour as rapacious, you disapprove of their greedy or selfish behaviour. 贪婪的")<sup>贪婪的</sup> modern empire? It is a `well-worn`<sup>老生常谈的</sup> but neuralgic dispute. In the past 18 months alone hundreds of Ethiopians have been killed and millions uprooted by ethnic conflicts that often draw on historical [`grievances`](    "If you have a grievance about something that has happened or been done, you believe that it was unfair. 委屈; 不满")<sup>委屈</sup>, real or exaggerated. “The problem is, we don’t have a [`consensus`](  "A consensus is general agreement among a group of people. 共识")<sup>共识</sup> on the fundamentals of our history,” notes Mulugeta Gebrehiwot, author of a book on the EPRDF. 

Abiy tends to stress nationhood, with its sense of gradual consolidation, rather than the frictions of empire; according to the museum, Ethiopia is a nation with ancient roots. But that, too, puts the prime minister `at odds`<sup>争执</sup> with those in his party who decry past imperial conquests. Some think he has been `precipitous`<sup>鲁莽的</sup> in opening Unity Park. “There needs to be a political consensus,” says Mohammed Girma, a religious scholar. “It’s a good idea but he should’ve consulted his Oromo constituency rather than rushing to build it.” 

The museum’s overseers are [`unmoved`]( "If you are unmoved by something, you are not emotionally affected by it. 无动于衷的")<sup>无动于衷的</sup> by the criticisms. “We have to respect what happened in the past,” argues Abebaw. “We cannot always be at odds with it.” Tamrat, the director, is gathering exhibits for the rooms that remain empty. Many Ethiopian artefacts have been `looted`<sup>掠夺</sup>; others are still in private hands. Though some individuals have begun donating items, Tamrat says, others are cautious. After all, family homes can be safer than museums in a place where history is a battlefield.

<h3 id="1.3">Palm Beach and the rise of American celebrity</h3>
Palm Beach, Mar-a-Lago and the Rise of America’s `Xanadu`<sup>世外桃源</sup>. By Les Standiford.Atlantic Monthly Press; 288 pages; $27. 

“THE RICH are different from you and me, we all know that even if some of the people in Palm Beach don’t,” the writer Nora Ephron said of the town in south Florida where society is the local industry. In “Palm Beach, Mar-a-Lago and the Rise of America’s Xanadu”, Les Standiford, author of a book about Andrew Carnegie and Henry Clay Frick, traces the history of a sandbar lifted from `swamp`<sup>沼泽</sup> and scrub to `gilded`<sup>镀金的</sup> glory by the Florida East Coast Railway line. 

Lapped by the Atlantic to the east and Lake Worth to the west, Palm Beach has been home to an epic cast of characters. Henry Flagler, who laid the railway at the turn of the 20th century, also built a string of `majestic`<sup>庄严的</sup> hotels—including the Ponce de Leon in St Augustine and the Royal Poinciana and the Breakers in Palm Beach itself. Marjorie Merriweather Post, a cereal `heiress`<sup>女继承人</sup> and `philanthropist`<sup>慈善家</sup>, built the 115-room Mar-a-Lago (dismissed by a local as “early Bastardian Spanish”) and took four husbands. The architect Addison Mizner set the town’s Mediterranean-Moorish tone (“Ali Baba Comes to Florida,” judges Mr Standiford). Among the newest arrivals are iguanas `inadvertently`<sup>无心地</sup> introduced from South America. 

Palm Beach, Mr Standiford observes in a book that will appeal to nose-pressed-against-the-glass readers, helped redefine class in America. Once upon a time, status was [`predicated`]( "If you say that one situation is predicated on another, you mean that the first situation can be true or real only if the second one is true or real. 基于; 取决于")<sup>断言</sup> on `lineage`<sup>血统</sup> and ancestors who had arrived on the Mayflower. That was before celebrity “became the new `imprimatur`<sup>许可</sup> of consequence”. Newport, Rhode Island? `Stale`<sup>缺乏新鲜感的</sup> upper crust. Saratoga Springs? That crème de la crème had curdled. For social [`cachet`]( "If someone or something has a certain cachet, they have a quality which makes people admire them or approve of them. 威信")<sup>威望</sup> without the prerequisite of [`pedigree`](   "Someone's pedigree is their background or their ancestors. (人的) 背景; 出身")<sup>血统</sup>, up-and-coming Americans looked to Palm Beach, which has welcomed the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, King Hussein of Jordan and the pornographer Larry Flynt. 

It was also where, in 2005, Melania Knauss, a model, married reality-show host, future president and [`latter-day`](    "Latter-day is used to describe someone or something that is a modern equivalent of a person or thing in the past. (旧时的人或物的)当代翻版的")<sup>当代的</sup> lord of Mar-a-Lago Donald Trump, with Elton John and Hillary and Bill Clinton among the big names and net worths in attendance. Buying Mar-a-Lago and its [`furnishings`]( "If you furnish a room or building, you put furniture and furnishings into it. 装潢; 布置 (房间、建筑物)")<sup>装潢</sup> for $8m in 1985 was Mr Trump’s ticket to Palm Beach—now his permanent residence after he and New York fell out of love. Post had [`bequeathed`](  "If you bequeath your money or property to someone, you legally state that they should have it when you die. 遗赠")<sup>遗赠</sup> the property to the National Park Service in 1973, for use as a winter White House, but in 1981 Congress returned it to the Post Foundation as too expensive to maintain. It was put on the market and Mr Trump [`snapped it up`](   "If you snap something up, you buy it quickly because it is cheap or is just what you want. 争购")<sup>抢购</sup>. 

Now it is a private club, with a portrait of Post on a wall in the former library, across from a younger version of the current [`proprietor`]( "The proprietor of a hotel, shop, newspaper, or other business is the person who owns it. 业主")<sup>业主</sup> in tennis gear. The announcement, when the club opened, that Prince Charles and Lady Diana had bought memberships was “rubbish”, said Buckingham Palace; but Mr Trump was `undeterred`<sup>未受阻的</sup>. “Even people who hate me are joining the club,” he crowed. The initiation fee is now said to be $200,000. One day, probably, rising seas will sink Palm Beach and leave behind a level, if [`soggy`](    "Something that is soggy is unpleasantly wet. 湿乎乎的")<sup>透湿的</sup>, playing field.

<h3 id="1.4">The art and loves of George Eliot</h3>
In Love with George Eliot. By Kathy O’Shaughnessy.Scribe; 400 pages; £16.99. 

THIS MONTH marks the 200th anniversary of the birth of George Eliot—author of one of the greatest novels of the Victorian or any age, “Middlemarch”, a social `panorama`<sup>全景</sup> set in a provincial English town in the years before the Reform Act of 1832 and the transformative arrival of the railway. “One of the few English novels written for grown-up people,” according to Virginia Woolf, “Middlemarch” was probably based on `Coventry`<sup>放逐</sup>, where Eliot—real name Marian Evans—had partly grown up. 

She `reluctantly`<sup>不情愿地</sup> revealed her true identity after the publication of her first novel, “Adam Bede”, in 1859, and was almost as well known for her `scandalous`<sup>可耻的</sup> private life as for her books. A respected scholar and the first female supremo of the Westminster Review, she lived openly with a married man, George Henry Lewes; her writing supported not only their household but that of his wife, Agnes, their children and Agnes’s by another man. Less than two years after Lewes’s death in 1878, the author caused more outrage by marrying John Walter Cross, a family friend 20 years her junior, who in a fit of [`mania`](    "Mania is a mental illness which causes the sufferer to become very worried or concerned about something. 狂躁症")<sup>狂躁</sup> attempted suicide on their honeymoon in Venice. In December 1880, seven months after their wedding—and just after her 61st birthday—she died. 

“In Love with George Eliot”, Kathy O’Shaughnessy’s sensitive, `impeccably`<sup>无可挑剔地</sup> researched and deeply pleasurable debut novel, charts Eliot’s development as a writer and growing celebrity, her sincere happiness with Lewes, terrible grief at his death and unexpected joy at her new (and finally respectable) married status. As the best historical novels do, it absorbs the reader to such an extent that, even if they know the outline of the story, each page is a revelation. Quoting from original letters and other documents, it shimmers with the `refracted`<sup>折射的</sup> light of another age; the account of a modern-day love triangle between three Eliot experts, which Ms O’Shaughnessy intercuts with chapters on the novelist and her circle, enhances the main picture. 

Eliot’s own unconventional looks, lifestyle and opinions are rendered `compellingly`<sup>咄咄逼人地</sup>. To many—including some well-drawn, `fervent`<sup>热心的</sup> female acolytes—her combination of sincerity, `neediness`<sup>贫穷</sup>, ambition and sympathy were `alluring`<sup>吸引人的</sup>. These qualities found a natural outlet in her writing. “It seems to me we can never give up longing and wishing while we are thoroughly alive,” remarks a character in “The Mill on the Floss”. In her own novel, Ms O’Shaughnessy brings this mix of intensity and playfulness winningly to life.

<h3 id="1.5">The slippery talent of Emmanuel Carrère</h3>
97,196 Words. By Emmanuel Carrère. Translated by John Lambert.Farrar, Straus & Giroux; 294 pages; $28. Jonathan Cape; £18.99. 

EMMANUEL CARRèRE is known for the way he bends and breaks genres. His essays and books pick through the minds of murderers, con-men, Russian revolutionaries, artists, `power-brokers`<sup>权力经纪人</sup>, addicts and the [`downtrodden `](  "People who are downtrodden are treated very badly by people with power, and do not have the ability or the energy to do anything about it. 受压迫的")<sup>受压迫的</sup>; even his own friends, family and lovers. He started as a novelist in his 20s and 30s, and now, at 61, is the most celebrated writer of high-end nonfiction in France. What distinguishes his `prose`<sup>散文</sup> is not its lyricism—as John Lambert’s translation conveys, it is simple and spare—but his intrusive, philosophical first-person voice. Mr Carrère is a character in his narratives and portraits, always there reminding you that it’s him, Emmanuel, writing the words that you are reading. 

In this collection of his essays, an interview with Catherine Deneuve, an actor, turns into the story, “How I Completely `Botched`<sup>糟蹋</sup> My Interview with Catherine Deneuve”; a column for an Italian magazine revolves around Mr Carrère’s fraught correspondence with his editor; and a report on a crime is rendered as a personal letter to the mother of the killer. The author is everywhere. At first, this relentless self-reflection seems `solipsistic`<sup>唯我论的</sup> and overdone—a kind of post-modern posturing—but the ultimate effects are `subtler`<sup>微妙的</sup> and deeper. Readers learn far more about Ms Deneuve, her `cunning`<sup>狡猾的</sup> and restraint, than other writers might relay, and all this happens while Mr Carrère is detailing his own nervousness and the supposed failure of the encounter. At bottom, he has two `exceptional`<sup>异常的</sup>, but rather traditional, writerly gifts: psychological [`acuity`](    "Acuity is sharpness of vision or hearing, or quickness of thought. (视觉或听觉)敏锐度; (思维)敏捷度")<sup>敏锐</sup> and narrative tautness. And he has learned how to dress those skills in clever conceits. 

Mr Carrère’s trademark style crystallised while he was working on his book “The [`Adversary`](  "Your adversary is someone you are competing with, or arguing or fighting against. 对手")<sup>对手</sup>” (2000). It was intended as an account of Jean-Claude Romand, a French murderer who in 1993 killed his wife, children, parents and dog, and attempted to kill himself, after almost two decades of pretending to be a researcher at the World Health Organisation. Inspired by Truman Capote’s “In Cold Blood”, Mr Carrère tried, and failed, to write the book for six years; then, a few days after abandoning the project, he sat down and penned a simple report for himself, summarising the work he had done. It began: “On the Saturday morning of January 9th 1993, while Jean-Claude Romand was killing his wife and children, I was with mine in a parent-teacher meeting at the school attended by Gabriel, our eldest son.” After a few pages, Mr Carrère realised that he was writing the very book that had [`eluded`](  "If a fact or idea eludes you, you do not succeed in understanding it, realizing it, or remembering it. 把…难住")<sup>难住</sup> him for years. It was simply a matter of “saying yes to the first person”.  

This accidental style has since become a sort of [`credo`]( "A credo is a set of beliefs, principles, or opinions that strongly influence the way a person lives or works. 信条")<sup>信条</sup>. It is `mendacious`<sup>虚假的</sup>, Mr Carrère suggests, for authors to pretend that they exist above or outside a  `rigorously`<sup>严厉地</sup> crafted piece of writing, as Capote did for instance. “I don’t think you can put yourself in other people’s positions. Nor should you,” he has argued. “All you can do is occupy your own, as fully as possible, and say that you are trying to imagine what it’s like to be someone else, but say it’s you who’s imagining it, and that’s all. 

It is hard to tell whether this is philosophical high-mindedness or `faux`<sup>人造的</sup> naivety—because the core of Mr Carrère’s talent is precisely that he brings readers into sympathetic contact with others, powerful and powerless, insiders and outsiders. His own textual persona is less flesh-and-blood than an [`ethereal`]( "Someone or something that is ethereal has a delicate beauty. 优雅的")<sup>优雅的</sup>, emotionally distant presence. His “I” becomes a transparency, a way of portraying others—whether it be a bereaved parent or President Emmanuel Macron—through himself. It is a masterful illusion. The more words Mr Carrère expends on his own life, the farther away he seems, and the closer the reader gets to the lives of others.

<h3 id="2.1">A new type of genetic profiling promises cleverer, better-looking children</h3>
DEBATE ABOUT using science to create “bespoke” human beings of one sort or another usually revolves around the ideas of genetic engineering and cloning. People worry about these for two reasons. One is practical. The [`tinkering`]( "If you tinker with something, you make some small changes to it, in an attempt to improve it or repair it. 小修改")<sup>小修改</sup> involved could end up harming the resulting individual. The other is a more [`visceral`](    "Visceral feelings are feelings that you feel very deeply and find it difficult to control or ignore, and that are not the result of thought. 发自肺腑的; 出自内心的")<sup>发自内心的</sup> dislike of interfering with the process of reproduction, perhaps best [`encapsulated`]( "To encapsulate particular facts or ideas means to represent all their most important aspects in a very small space or in a single object or event. 概括")<sup>概况</sup> in the phrase “playing God”. 

There is, however, a third way that the genetic dice which are thrown at the beginning of human life might be loaded—and it does not involve any risky tinkering. It is a twist on the well-established procedure of in `vitro`<sup>试管</sup> fertilisation (IVF). The twist would be to decide, on the basis of their DNA, which of a group of available embryos should be implanted and brought to term. 

The result would be a child optimised with the best-available genetic profile for a long and healthy life. And this is not science fiction. Two American firms have been working on the idea for some time, and one of them is now implementing it (see article). 

Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP, or “snip”) profiling, as the technique is called, promises healthier [`offspring`](    "You can refer to a person's children or to an animal's young as their offspring. 子女; 幼崽")<sup>后代</sup>—a clear good. It may also provide a way to upgrade things only tangentially associated with health, such as height and, more `controversially`<sup>颇有争议的</sup>, intelligence. Moreover, it is a technique that could be applied generation on generation, to improve grandchildren and great-grandchildren still further. 

SNPs are the smallest possible differences between individuals’ DNA—single genetic letters. Individually, most have little consequence. But there are millions of them in every human genome and their combined effects can be big. SNP profiling looks for particular combinations of SNPs that research has shown are associated with the risks of developing illnesses such as cancer, `diabetes`<sup>糖尿病</sup> and heart disease. This is important medical information for people now alive, and can be used to recommend screening programmes, changes of behaviour and `prophylactic`<sup>预防疾病的</sup> drugs. 

For those willing to undergo IVF, and with the money to pay for it, it may also be possible to SNP-profile an embryo and thus foretell its future. As well as disease risk, height and intelligence, SNP-profiling might eventually be capable of predicting [`albeit`](   "You use albeit to introduce a fact or comment that reduces the force or significance of what you have just said. 尽管")<sup>虽然</sup> imperfectly, for environment also plays a role) things as diverse as television-viewing habits, likelihood of being bullied at school and probability of getting divorced. 

At the moment, non-medical attributes are not on the menu offered by would-be embryo SNP-profilers. But if the technique works it is hard to believe that they will not be on someone’s menu in the future. And that does raise questions. 

What all this [`amounts to`](   "If you say that one thing amounts to something else, you consider the first thing to be the same as the second thing. 等同于")<sup>相当于</sup> is, in essence, a supercharged version of an existing process known as `assortative mating`<sup>婚姻市场</sup>. It is already true that intelligent, successful (and therefore probably rich) people seek each other out as partners. In doing so, they bring to the table whatever genetic variations helped make them intelligent, successful and rich, which they then pass on to their children. SNP profiling—available, at least to start with, only to those who can afford it—will enhance that by letting parents pick tall, good-looking and above all clever offspring. 

For a single generation, that may not matter too much to the rest of society. It would be but one extra privilege that the rich enjoy. Piled generation on generation, however, it really might create a genetic elite. SNP-profiling is already used to enhance desired attributes in [`livestock`](   "Animals such as cattle and sheep which are kept on a farm are referred to as livestock. 家畜")<sup>家畜</sup>, so it seems reasonable to assume it will work on people. 

Perhaps that is tomorrow’s problem. For the moment there seems no reason beyond envy to oppose embryo SNP-profiling. But, from H.G. Wells’s Eloi in “The Time Machine” to Aldous Huxley’s Alphas in “Brave New World”, science fiction is full of breeding programmes for elite humans that have gone wrong. Sci-fi always enjoys portraying dystopias, and mostly they do not come true. But it might be wise to debate the matter now, just in case this time people really are unknowingly playing God.

<h3 id="2.2">Assessing Emmanuel Macron’s apocalyptic vision</h3>
TODAY’S EUROPE owes its existence to the United States. America fought two world wars on European soil; American diplomacy was midwife to what became the European Union; American arms protected western Europe from Soviet invasion; and American statesmen oversaw German unification. Now, in a dramatic plea to all Europeans, France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, has warned that America is cutting Europe loose. The old continent is “on the edge of a [`precipice`]( "If you say that someone is on the edge of a precipice, you mean that they are in a dangerous situation in which they are extremely close to disaster or failure. 险境; 危局")<sup>险境</sup>”, he warns. Unless it wakes up, “we will no longer be in control of our destiny.” 

In his Elysée Palace office, Mr Macron spoke to The Economist in apocalyptic terms (see article). NATO, the transatlantic alliance, is suffering from “brain-death”, he says; Europe needs to develop a military force of its own. The EU thinks of itself as just a market, but it needs to act as a political bloc, with policies on technology, data and climate change to match. Past French presidents have argued that Europe cannot rely on America, and should look to France instead. Mr Macron is not just rehashing this view. He believes that America and Europe have shared interests and has worked tirelessly to keep good relations with President Donald Trump. But he argues that for the first time America has a president who “does not share our idea of the European project”. And even if Mr Trump is not re-elected, historical forces are pulling the old allies apart. 

American priorities are changing. When President Barack Obama, who was intent on pivoting towards Asia, chose not to punish the use of chemical weapons in Syria it signalled that America was losing interest in the Middle East. Mr Trump’s recent abandonment of America’s Kurdish allies in Syria not only reinforced this, but also undermined NATO. America did not inform its allies, and Turkey, a NATO member, promptly invaded Syria. “Strategically and politically,” Mr Macron says, “we need to recognise that we have a problem.” 

Asked whether he is confident that an attack on one NATO member would today be seen as an attack on all—the idea that [`underpins`](    "If one thing underpins another, it helps the other thing to continue or succeed by supporting and strengthening it. 支撑; 加固")<sup>巩固</sup> the alliance’s credibility—Mr Macron says that he does not know. He acknowledges that NATO thrives operationally, but he calls for Europe “to reassess the reality of what NATO is in the light of the commitment of the United States.” 

Europe, he says, has yet to grasp the immensity of the challenge ahead. It still treats the world as if commerce and trade alone were able to ensure peace. But America, the guarantor of world trade, is becoming protectionist. Authoritarian powers are on the rise—including Russia and Turkey on Europe’s borders. While America and China spend vast sums on artificial intelligence, which they see as an essential component of their hard power, the EU devolves too much say to industry. Mr Macron warns that slow-moving, head-in-the-clouds Europe must open its eyes and prepare itself for a tougher, less forgiving world. 

It is an astonishingly bleak picture for a centrist European politician and an avowed internationalist. But it is also unusually thought-through and, as far as Mr Macron is concerned, a `spur`<sup>鼓舞</sup> to action. It is hard to overstate the scale of the change he is asking from his fellow Europeans. 

Take defence. Mr Macron thinks that his new European Intervention Initiative and the EU’s Permanent Structured Co-operation, underpinned by the European Defence Fund, can integrate military operations and boost Europe’s capabilities, by implication providing a foundation for Europe’s post-NATO defence. But these building-blocks are `rudimentary`<sup>基本的</sup>. America’s departure would leave vast holes in areas like air and missile defence, intelligence and surveillance, and aerial refuelling. Its military budget is twice as large as the rest of NATO’s combined. European governments will be [`reluctant`]( "If you are reluctant to do something, you are unwilling to do it and hesitate before doing it, or do it slowly and without enthusiasm. 不愿意的; 勉强的")<sup>不情愿的</sup> to plug the gap, since they have other priorities. It may be easier to adapt NATO, so that it both protects Europe and is also more useful to the United States. 

And then there is diplomacy. Mr Macron thinks Europe can best establish its global influence as a power that mediates between the gorillas of China and the United States. Its role will be “to stop the whole world from catching fire”, he says. A first step would be to get a grip on its own region by rebuilding relations with Russia—a task that he accepts could well take a decade. 

Again, however, that ambition assumes a unity of purpose that the EU seldom achieves. Many of its members tend to [`shun`]( "If you shun someone or something, you deliberately avoid them or keep away from them. 有意回避")<sup>避免</sup> hard power for a foreign policy focused on human rights and commerce. As Mr Macron’s Russian proposal illustrates, power politics requires you to deal with people whose actions you [`deplore`](  "If you say that you deplore something, you think it is very wrong or immoral. 谴责")<sup>谴责</sup>. For him, realpolitik is necessary for European values to `prevail`<sup>流行</sup>. It is not clear his fellow European leaders would agree. 

Last is industrial policy. Mr Macron wants the state to take strategic decisions over key technologies, and favours a policy to foster European champions. This tends to channel funds and contracts to politically connected incumbents. A better way to create a `thriving`<sup>繁荣的</sup> technology ecosystem would be to encourage more competition. If Mr Macron will not embrace that, why should others? 

The EU’s formula is unique: an arrangement between states, without any `hegemon`<sup>经济霸主</sup>, that keeps the peace. But how do you get 27 countries—plus Britain, a big power now in the EU’s departure lounge—to agree to build fully functional armed forces, let alone convince Europe’s `foes`<sup>敌人</sup> that they would ever be used? Mr Macron’s critics [`scoff`](   "If you scoff at something, you speak about it in a way that shows you think it is ridiculous or inadequate. 嘲笑")<sup>嘲笑</sup> that he is “drunk on power”. Some countries, including Poland and the Baltic states, would be alarmed at the idea of parting with America and pursuing [`detente`](  "Detente is a state of friendly relations between two countries when previously there had been problems between them. (两国紧张关系的)缓和")<sup>缓和</sup> with Russia. Others, including Germany, Italy and Spain, are too [`embroiled`]( "If you become embroiled in a fight or argument, you become deeply involved in it. 使卷入的")<sup>牵连</sup> in domestic `woes`<sup>灾难</sup> to entertain a grand global vision. 

Plenty of times in the past, pious calls for Europe to make its weight felt in the world have turned out to be empty. This time, Mr Macron argues, must be different. He is asking his fellow leaders to imagine how Europe will `thrive`<sup>繁荣</sup> in a dangerous world without a cast-iron American alliance. How should they deal with Russia, with the conflict and religious fundamentalism roiling the Middle East and north Africa, and with the authoritarian challenge of China? He deserves an answer.

<h3 id="2.3">Billionaires are only rarely policy failures</h3>

BASHING BILLIONAIRES is gaining popularity—especially among candidates to be America’s president. Elizabeth Warren wants to take up to 6% of their wealth in tax every year. Bernie Sanders says they “should not exist”. “Every billionaire is a policy failure,” goes a common left-wing slogan. In Britain’s election, too, the super-rich are under fire. Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the Labour Party, says that a fair society would contain none. On October 31st he vowed to [`go after`]( "If you go after something, you try to get it, catch it, or hit it. 追求,追捕,追击")<sup>追击</sup> Britain’s `plutocrats`<sup>富豪</sup>, [`singling out`](    "If you single someone out from a group, you choose them and give them special attention or treatment. 选出; 挑出")<sup>挑出</sup> five individuals and bemoaning a “corrupt system”. 

Left-wingers blasting inequality is nothing new. But the idea that vast personal fortunes are made possible only when government goes wrong is a more novel and serious idea. It is also misguided. Personal wealth is at best an unreliable signal of bad behaviour or failing policies. Often the `reverse`<sup>背面</sup> is true. 

The left’s charge is based on a kernel of truth. When competition is fierce and fair, persistently high profits should be difficult to sustain. Yet on both sides of the Atlantic too many companies  [`crank out`]( "If you say that a company or person cranks out a quantity of similar things, you mean they produce them quickly, in the same way, and are usually implying that the things are not original or are of poor quality. 迅速地大量滥制")<sup>粗制滥造</sup> `bumper`<sup>巨大的</sup> profits in concentrated markets. Some billionaires have thrived where competition has failed. Facebook and Google dominate online advertising; Warren Buffett likes firms with `“moats”`<sup>护城河</sup> that keep rivals out. Meanwhile America’s political system is riddled with `lobbyists`<sup>说客</sup> cheerleading for incumbents. About a fifth of America’s billionaires made their money in industries in which government capture or market failure is commonplace (see article). 

Yet many others operate in competitive markets. The retailers owned by Mike Ashley, one of Mr Corbyn’s targets, are known for low prices and `ruthless`<sup>无情的</sup> competition (as well as questionable working conditions), not rent-seeking. For every Mark Zuckerberg, the boss of Facebook, there are several technology entrepreneurs with lots of rivals. Think of Anthony Wood, who created Roku, a video-streaming platform; or Tim Sweeney, co-founder of the firm behind “Fortnite”, a video game. Nobody can seriously accuse these innovators of having sewn up their markets or of depending on state favours. The same goes for sportsmen such as Michael Jordan or musicians like Jay-Z, billionaires both. Even hedge funds face ferocious competition for investors’ funds, which is why so many are `throwing in the towel`<sup>认输</sup>. 

When capitalism functions well, competition whittles profits away for some but also produces them for others as entrepreneurs seize markets from sleepy incumbents. Their success will eventually set off another cycle of disruption, but in the meantime fortunes can be made. The founders of MySpace, a social-media website, got rich when they sold it to News Corp; Facebook subsequently ate its lunch. Blockbuster, a video-rental store, helped make Wayne Huizenga a billionaire; then Netflix arrived. This process creates vast benefits for society. According to estimates by William Nordhaus, an economist, between 1948 and 2001 innovators captured only 2% of the value they created. Perhaps that is why billionaires are tolerated even by countries with [`impeccable`]( "If you describe something such as someone's behaviour or appearance as impeccable, you are emphasizing that it is perfect and has no faults. 无可挑剔的")<sup>无可挑剔的</sup> social-democratic credentials: Sweden and Norway have more billionaires per person than America does. 

Taxes should be levied progressively. But that does not justify limitless redistribution or punitive levies. Ms Warren’s proposed wealth tax has already doubled once during her campaign. Thomas Piketty, an economist behind many of the most-cited inequality statistics, wants a wealth tax of up to 90% on the richest billionaires. Such `expropriation`<sup>征收</sup> would surely chill incentives to innovate and to allocate capital efficiently. An economy with fewer entrepreneurs might have fewer billionaires but would ultimately be less dynamic, leaving everyone worse off. 

Wealth is worrying when it becomes `entrenched`<sup>根深蒂固的</sup> or shielded from disruptive forces. Where that `decay`<sup>腐烂</sup> has set in, governments should tackle it directly. Whatever Mr Corbyn says, Britain is hardly corrupt by global standards—[`bribery`](   "Bribery is the act of offering someone money or something valuable in order to persuade them to do something for you. 贿赂行为")<sup>贿赂</sup> is rare, for example. But it does have a problem with inherited wealth, the source of one-fifth of billionaires’ fortunes. Higher inheritance taxes would be welcome there and in America, where it is too easy to pass wealth between the generations. 

A broader agenda of attacking rents while maintaining dynamism would weaken excessive intellectual-property and copyright protections, which often last too long. (Selling Lucasfilm more than three decades after the first “Star Wars” film should not have netted George Lucas $4bn.) It would shake up [`antitrust`](   "In the United States, antitrust laws are intended to stop big companies taking over their competitors, fixing prices with their competitors, or interfering with free competition in any way. 反垄断的")<sup>反垄断的</sup> enforcement to promote competition in old and new industries alike. Most important, it would fix America’s campaign-finance laws to rid its political system of corporate capture at both state and federal level. 

Doing all this would achieve much more than an [`indiscriminate`](  "If you describe an action as indiscriminate, you are critical of it because it does not involve any careful thought or choice. 任意而为的")<sup>任意而为的</sup> attack on the rich—and without the associated damage. By all means, correct policy failures. But billionaires are usually the wrong target.

<h3 id="2.4">How to stop Cameroon collapsing into a full-fledged civil war</h3>
FOR 37 YEARS one man has ruled Cameroon, a `staggeringly`<sup>摇晃地</sup> corrupt, oil-rich state in central Africa. President Paul Biya is an old-fashioned `autocrat`<sup>独裁者</sup>. When democracy swept across Africa after the cold war ended, he called it a “distasteful passing fetish”. Then he realised he would attract less foreign criticism if he quietly intimidated opponents and rigged elections instead of banning them. He has done so ever since, and kept on good terms with Western powers by posing as a champion of stability in a fissile region. His troops, trained and equipped by France, Israel and America, battle the `jihadists`<sup>圣战主义者</sup> of Boko Haram and Islamic State around Lake Chad. They also regularly don blue helmets to keep peace in countries such as the Central African Republic. Yet Mr Biya cannot keep the peace at home. 

Instead, a country that was once seen as an exporter of security is now being wrenched apart. A [`secession`](  "The secession of a region or group from the country or larger group to which it belongs is the action of formally becoming separate. (从国家或大集团中正式的)脱离")<sup>脱离</sup> struggle rages in its English-speaking regions. Government forces are burning villages, shooting young men and raping women (see article). The conflict has killed thousands and forced more than 500,000 people from their homes. 

The [`strife`]( "Strife is strong disagreement or fighting. 冲突")<sup>冲突</sup> began as a series of peaceful protests in 2016. Anglophones were [`aggrieved`](   "If you feel aggrieved, you feel upset and angry because of the way in which you have been treated. 愤愤不平的")<sup>受委屈的</sup> at their marginalisation in a country dominated by French-speakers. Cameroon is too `rigidly`<sup>严格地</sup> centralised to satisfy minorities: only 1% of government spending is locally controlled, compared with more than 50% in neighbouring Nigeria. Strikes and demonstrations over the erosion of English-style common law and the dominance of Francophone officials have since mutated into what looks like a civil war. It could get much worse, as chaos grows, armed separatists kill and soldiers inflict horrors on civilians. 

The outside world has barely noticed this disaster unfolding. Appeals for emergency assistance have attracted less than one-fifth of their target: less than half the people who have lost their homes have been given the two pieces of plastic and rope that make up the UN’s shelter kit. Cameroon’s main backers have looked away, hoping Mr Biya’s government would `quell`<sup>平息</sup> the rebellion and get back to fighting jihadists in the Sahel. Instead of corralling the warring parties, the African Union and UN Security Council have stood aside, rousing themselves only to “welcome” and “praise” Mr Biya’s “national dialogue”, a [`sham`](  "Something that is a sham is not real or is not really what it seems to be. 假的东西")<sup>假的东西</sup> to which key separatist leaders were not invited. 

This is a disgrace. The conflict, although bloody, is not `intractable`<sup>棘手的</sup>. Most people in Cameroon’s two English-speaking regions are probably moderate and would be happy with some more autonomy and an end to the fighting. They could find common ground with those on the government side who might be willing to give a bit more power to the regions. 

The longer the fighting persists, the harder it will be to resolve. With the army and separatists in [`stalemate`]( "Stalemate is a situation in which neither side in an argument or contest can win or in which no progress is possible. 僵局")<sup>僵局</sup> on the battlefield, peace can come only through talks. For those to happen, both sides need to build trust. The separatists should start by lifting the ruinous ban they enforce on children going to government schools in the areas they control, which threatens to create a lost generation of `illiterates`<sup>文盲</sup>. Rebel leaders abroad should `tone down`<sup>缓和</sup> their inflammatory talk of secession. The government should release political prisoners and prosecute soldiers responsible for abuses. 

Outsiders should press Mr Biya to make peace. President Donald Trump has rightly scaled back military assistance because of [`atrocities`]( "An atrocity is a very cruel, shocking action. 暴行")<sup>暴行</sup> committed by the army. He has also kicked Cameroon out of a programme which grants duty-free access to the US market to African countries that respect human rights. European governments should also turn the screws, especially France, Mr Biya’s closest ally. The ageing strongman once said that only one-party rule could hold Cameroon together. In fact, his overcentralised autocracy has created pressures that could blow it apart. Only dialogue and [`devolution`](   "Devolution is the transfer of some authority or power from a central organization or government to smaller organizations or government departments. (中央机构或政府权力的) 下放")<sup>权力下放</sup> can save it.

<h3 id="2.5">Women in public life are increasingly subject to sexual slander. Don’t believe it</h3>
ADULTERER, PERVERT, traitor, murderer. In France in 1793, no woman was more `relentlessly`<sup>残酷地</sup> slandered than Marie Antoinette. Political [`pamphlets`](   "A pamphlet is a very thin book with a paper cover that gives information about something. 小册子")<sup>小册子</sup> spread baseless rumours of her [`depravity`](  "Depravity is very dishonest or immoral behaviour. 堕落")<sup>堕落</sup>. Some drawings showed her with multiple lovers, male and female. Others portrayed her as a `harpy`<sup>鸟身女妖</sup>, a `notoriously`<sup>众所周知地</sup> disagreeable mythical beast that was half `bird-of-prey`<sup>食肉鸟</sup>, half woman. Such [`mudslinging`](   "If you accuse someone of mudslinging, you are accusing them of making insulting, unfair, and damaging remarks about their opponents. 诽谤; 中伤")<sup>诽谤</sup> served a political purpose. The revolutionaries who had overthrown the monarchy wanted to tarnish the former queen’s reputation before they cut off her head. 

She was a victim of something ancient and nasty that is becoming worryingly common: sexualised [`disinformation`](  "If you accuse someone of spreading disinformation, you are accusing them of spreading false information in order to deceive people. 假信息")<sup>虚假信息</sup> to undercut women in public life (see article). People have always invented rumours about such women. But three things have changed. Digital technology makes it easy to `disseminate`<sup>传播</sup> `libel`<sup>诽谤</sup> widely and anonymously. “Deepfake” techniques (manipulating images and video using artificial intelligence) make it cheap and simple to create convincing visual evidence that people have done or said things which they have not. And powerful actors, including governments and ruling parties, have `gleefully`<sup>欢欣地</sup> exploited these new opportunities. A report by researchers at Oxford this year found well-organised disinformation campaigns in 70 countries, up from 48 in 2018 and 28 in 2017. 

Consider the case of Rana Ayyub, an Indian journalist who tirelessly reports on corruption, and who wrote a book about the `massacre`<sup>大屠杀</sup> of Muslims in the state of Gujarat when Narendra Modi, now India’s prime minister, was in charge there. For years, critics `muttered`<sup>抱怨地说</sup> that she was unpatriotic (because she is a Muslim who criticises the ruling party) and a prostitute (because she is a woman). In April 2018 the abuse intensified. A deepfake sex video, which `grafted`<sup>嫁接</sup> her face over that of another woman, was published and went `viral`<sup>病毒性的</sup>. Digital `mobs`<sup>暴徒</sup> threatened to rape or kill her. She was “doxxed”: someone published her home address and phone number online. It is hard to prove who was behind this campaign of `intimidation`<sup>恐吓</sup>, but its purpose is obvious: to silence her, and any other woman thinking of criticising the `mighty`<sup>有势力的人</sup>. 

Similar [`tactics`](    "Tactics are the methods that you choose to use in order to achieve what you want in a particular situation. 战术")<sup>策略</sup> are used to [`deter`](   "To deter someone from doing something means to make them not want to do it or continue doing it. 阻止")<sup>阻止</sup> women from running for public office. In the [`run-up`]( "The run-up to an event is the period of time just before it. 前夕")<sup>预备阶段</sup> to elections in Iraq last year, two female candidates were humiliated with explicit videos, which they say were faked. One pulled out of the race. The types of image used to degrade women vary from place to place. In Myanmar, where [`antipathy`]( "Antipathy is a strong feeling of dislike or hostility toward someone or something. 憎恶")<sup>憎恶</sup> towards Muslims is widespread, [`detractors`](    "The detractors of a person or thing are people who criticize that person or thing. 诋毁者")<sup>诽谤者</sup> of Aung San Suu Kyi, the country’s de facto leader, circulated a photo manipulated to show her wearing a hijab. By contrast in Iran, an Islamist `theocracy`<sup>神政</sup>, a woman was disqualified from taking the seat she had won when a photo, which she claims is doctored, leaked showing her without one. 

High-tech sexual slander has not replaced the old-fashioned sort, which remains [`rife`](   "If you say that something, usually something bad, is rife in a place or that the place is rife with it, you mean that it is very common. (常指坏事) 普遍的; 猖獗的")<sup>普遍的</sup> wherever politicians and their propagandists can get away with it. In Russia, female `dissidents`<sup>持不同意见的</sup> are dubbed sexual deviants in pro-Kremlin media. In the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte has joked about showing a pornographic video of a female opponent, which she says is a fake, to the pope. In China, mainland-based trolls have spread lewd quotes falsely attributed to Tsai Ing-wen, Taiwan’s first female president. Beijing’s state media say she is “extreme” and “emotional” as a result of being unmarried and childless. 

Stamping out the problem altogether will be impossible. Anyone can make a deepfake sex video, or hire someone to do it, for a pittance, and then distribute it anonymously. Politicians will inevitably be targets. Laws against libel or invasion of privacy may deter some abuses, but they are not much use when the `perpetrator`<sup>犯罪者</sup> is unknown. Reputable tech firms will no doubt try to remove the most [`egregious`]( "Egregious means very bad and offensive. 极坏的; 极恶劣的")<sup>极坏的</sup> content, but there will always be other platforms, some of them hosted by regimes that actively `sow`<sup>播种</sup> disinformation in the West. 

So the best defence against sexual lies is [`scepticism`](  "Scepticism is great doubt about whether something is true or useful. 怀疑")<sup>怀疑主义</sup>. People should assume that videos showing female politicians naked or having sex are probably `bogus`<sup>伪造的</sup>. Journalists should try harder to expose the `peddlers`<sup>传播者</sup> of fake [`footage`](    "Footage of a particular event is a film of it or the part of a film which shows this event. (描述某一事件的) 片段镜头")<sup>片段镜头</sup>, rather than mindlessly linking to it. Some day, one hopes, voters may even decide that it is none of their business what public figures look like under their clothes, or which [`consenting adults`]( "A consenting adult is a person who is considered to be old enough to make their own decisions about who they have sex with. 达到可以自主决定与谁发生性行为年龄的") they sleep with.

<h3 id="3.1">Emmanuel Macron on Europe’s fragile place in a hostile world</h3>
WHEN EMMANUEL MACRON stepped from his presidential plane onto the red carpet at the airport in Shanghai on November 4th, two flags were fluttering in the warm air: one Chinese, the other the French tricolore. This was only to be expected for a visiting French president, whom President Xi Jinping treated to two [`banquets`](   "A banquet is a grand formal dinner. 正式宴会")<sup>正式宴会</sup> and a private dinner, in two different cities. Yet the absence of a European Union flag was a small visual reminder of the scale of the diplomatic challenge Mr Macron has set himself. For the French president went to China this week not just to speak for France, but for Europe. 

Mr Macron’s message was carefully [`calibrated`](   "If you calibrate an instrument or tool, you mark or adjust it so that you can use it to measure something accurately. 校准")<sup>校准</sup>. When Germany’s `Chancellor`<sup>总理</sup> Angela Merkel jetted off to China in September, she took with her a large [`delegation`](  "A delegation is a group of people who have been sent somewhere to have talks with other people on behalf of a larger group of people. 代表团")<sup>代表团</sup> of German chief executives. Mr Macron also flew French businessmen with him to China, and pushed hard for better access to Chinese markets for French stuff. To make the point, Mr Macron and Mr Xi tasted high-end Bordeaux and morsels of French beef together at the Shanghai trade fair. 

Yet the French president also went “to show that Europe has a unified face”. He brought with him an Irish European commissioner and a German minister, and included a clutch of German business bosses in the French delegation. In a speech on trade, Mr Macron framed the stakes as European, and scarcely mentioned la France. With China ready to exploit the slightest European division, Mr Macron hoped to show that a common, strategic, `pan-European`<sup>泛欧洲的</sup> policy might be possible. 

Shortly before his China trip, Mr Macron laid out this vision of a more “strategic” and “sovereign” Europe in a candid interview with The Economist. The conversation took place late in the evening on October 21st at the Elysée Palace in the president’s gilt-decorated office, the salon doré, where Charles de Gaulle used to work. In the interview, Mr Macron is as `bleak`<sup>沮丧的</sup> about the [`perils`](  "Perils are great dangers. 极大危险")<sup>极大危险</sup> facing the continent as he is radical about his `prescriptions`<sup>方案</sup>. 

“Look at what is happening in the world. Things that were unthinkable five years ago,” the French president declares. “To be wearing ourselves out over Brexit, to have Europe finding it so difficult to move forward, to have an American ally turning its back on us so quickly on strategic issues; nobody would have believed this possible.” Europe is on “the edge of a [`precipice`](   "If you say that someone is on the edge of a precipice, you mean that they are in a dangerous situation in which they are extremely close to disaster or failure. 险境; 危局")<sup>险境</sup>”, he says. “If we don’t wake up…there’s a considerable risk that in the long run we will disappear geopolitically, or at least that we will no longer be in control of our destiny. I believe that very deeply.” 

Since the 1990s, says Mr Macron, the European Union has progressively lost its political purpose. Its focus on market expansion and regulation, `underpinned`<sup>巩固</sup> by the American defence guarantee, provided an illusion of `eternal`<sup>永恒的</sup> stability. America’s gradual `retreat`<sup>撤退</sup> from Europe and the Middle East, which he dates to before the election of President Donald Trump, combined with its new protectionism, has exposed Europe’s vulnerability. 

“But we find ourselves for the first time with an American president who doesn’t share our idea of the European project,” Mr Macron notes, and whose attitude to the risk of jihadist prisoners on the loose in Syria is that they will “be escaping to Europe”. When Mr Trump tells the French president that “it’s your neighbourhood, not mine”, says Mr Macron, what he is really saying is: “Wake up!” With America turning its back, China rising, and authoritarian leaders on the EU’s doorstep, the result is “the exceptional `fragility`<sup>脆弱</sup> of Europe”, Mr Macron concludes, “which, if it can’t think of itself as a global power, will disappear.” 

“What we are currently experiencing,” he declares, with reference to the withdrawal of troops from Syria, is “the brain-death of NATO”. Pressed to explain, he argues: “You have no co-ordination [`whatsoever`](   "You use whatsoever after a noun group in order to emphasize a negative statement. 任何 (用于名词词组之后，强调否定陈述)")<sup>无论</sup> of strategic decision-making between the United States and its NATO allies. None. You have an `unco-ordinated`<sup>不协调的</sup> aggressive action by another NATO ally, Turkey, in an area where our interests are `at stake`<sup>处于危险中</sup>.” Did this mean that Article Five—the idea that if one NATO member were attacked the others would come to its aid, which underpins the alliance’s [`deterrence`](    "Deterrence is the prevention of something, especially war or crime, by having something such as weapons or punishment to use as a threat. 威慑")<sup>威慑</sup>—is still functional? “I don’t know,” he replies. “But what will Article Five mean tomorrow?” 

The underlying message is `brutal`<sup>残忍的</sup>: Europe has to stop judging these times a historical anomaly, start asking whether NATO is fit for purpose, and get its act together. This is a view broadly shared by his countrymen (see chart 1). “Even if we don’t want to hear it,” he says, “we cannot in all responsibility fail to draw the conclusions, or at least begin to think about them.” 

Mr Macron, a philosophy graduate as well as a former investment banker, is considered to be more of a thinker than most world leaders. He tries to read for an hour or two each day. In Shanghai he slipped off for a private lunch with Chinese artists to `muse`<sup>沉思</sup> about freedom. Mr Macron’s deliberations have led him to conclude that what is needed is “European sovereignty”: the collective ability to defend Europe’s interests—over security, privacy, artificial intelligence, data, the environment, industry, trade and so forth—in a strategic way. 

During his interview, Mr Macron [`roams`](  "If you roam an area or roam around it, you wander or travel around it without having a particular purpose. 闲逛; 漫游")<sup>漫步</sup> across topics, moving from a psychological portrait of Vladimir Putin one moment to the perils of a low-interest-rate economy the next. Europe faces an almost-existential moment, he argues, as the world shifts from a global order based on rules to one determined by muscular power politics. Yet he does not seem to be `daunted`<sup>胆怯的</sup>. He has a more engaging manner than his [`aloof`]( "Someone who is aloof is not very friendly and does not like to spend time with other people. 冷淡的")<sup>冷淡的</sup> public persona, which has led to a reputation for `haughtiness`<sup>傲慢</sup>, would suggest. Moments such as when Mr Macron told off a teenager for not calling him “Monsieur” in 2018, or when he said in 2017 that railway stations were places where “one crosses people who succeed, and people who are nothing”, have added to this impression that he is arrogant and [`removed`](  "If you say that an idea or situation is far removed from something, you mean that it is very different from it. 非常不同的"). And, indeed, the bleakness of Mr Macron’s analysis is matched by an uncanny—and no doubt excessive—confidence in his own ability to do something about it. 

But can he? French Fifth-Republic presidents are fond of laying out sweeping visions of the world that appeal to the country’s grandeur. Over the years, when French leaders have called for a Europe puissance (European power), this has often sounded [`suspiciously`]( "If you say that one thing looks or sounds suspiciously like another thing, you mean that it probably is that thing, or something very similar to it, although it may be intended to seem different. 非常 (像)") like code for French `hegemonic`<sup>霸权的</sup> ambitions. Such efforts in the past have been dismissed in London or Washington as quaint, or dangerously undermining of NATO, or both. In 2003 during the Iraq war, when France, Germany, Belgium and Luxembourg held talks on such matters, their get-together was dismissed as a second-rate “chocolate summit”. 

Yet there are new reasons to try to understand the thinking in Paris. Mr Macron is an energetic diplomat, keen to shape the events he sees unfolding. For at least the next year, and possibly beyond, he will be the only ambitious leader of a liberal democracy who is also at the head of a nuclear power, with a military presence that reaches from Europe to the Pacific, a UN Security Council seat, strong executive powers and a robust parliamentary majority. Compare this with the agonies of Brexit Britain, Germany’s [`dysfunctional`]( "Dysfunctional is used to describe relationships or behaviour which are different from what is considered to be normal. (关系或行为)异常的")<sup>机能失调的</sup> coalition and [`faltering`](  "A faltering attempt, effort, or movement is uncertain because the person doing it is nervous or weak, or does not really know what to do. (尝试、努力、行动等)犹豫的; 蹒跚的")<sup>蹒跚的</sup> economy, or the political `paralysis`<sup>无力</sup> of Italy and Spain. 

The result could be that leadership in Europe could pivot to France. By default as well as inclination, says Benjamin Haddad of the Atlantic Council in Washington, DC, Mr Macron is well placed to become Europe’s new diplomatic leader. 

For sure, Mr Macron cannot compete with Mrs Merkel on experience. But, midway through his term, the 41-year-old French president has built up ties to many world leaders. Since taking office, Mr Macron has made 101 trips to over 50 different countries, including places (from Nigeria to India) outside France’s traditional sphere. His China trip was his second there as president. On his watch, Mr Trump has been four times to France. Even Mr Macron’s domestic standing has started to recover, having taken a bruising soon after coming into office. After the searing social unrest led by the gilets jaunes (yellow jackets) a year ago, his approval rating—still very low, at 34%—is at least back up to where it was before the protests began. (Mr Trump’s is at 41% and over the past three years has not slipped below 36%.) 

Moreover, despite some clumsy footwork, Mr Macron has manoeuvred a number of France-friendly appointees into top EU jobs. They include Ursula von der Leyen, the new head of the European Commission; Charles Michel, the incoming European Council president; and Christine Lagarde, who now runs the ECB. And France has secured a hefty new commission portfolio spanning the single market, industrial policy, digital, defence and space—although he failed to secure Sylvie Goulard for the job, after she became the first French candidate to be rejected by MEPs in Brussels for being unfit to take office. 

Some of the language in Europe has started to shift in Mr Macron’s direction, at least. Mrs von der Leyen says she wants to run a “geopolitical” commission. Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, has argued that “the EU needs a reality check; power is not a dirty word.” Mrs Merkel has told Europeans that, when it comes to their collective security, “the times when we could rely on others are over.” 

By the third day of his trip, French officials were pleased that a deal to protect regional European food labels—such as Roquefort blue cheese—in China, and vice versa, had been signed and that China seemed supportive on climate change. But they were also `candid`<sup>直言不讳的</sup> about how difficult it all is. 

China is a good test of whether Mr Macron can get Europe to speak as one voice, and whether Europe wants that voice to be Mr Macron’s. He has been outspoken about “China’s real diplomatic genius for playing on our divisions and weakening us”. He says he wants fellow Europeans to be less naive; he has argued it was “stupid” to sell essential infrastructure in southern Europe to the Chinese. He also wants the EU to insist on [`reciprocity`]( "Reciprocity is the exchange of something between people or groups of people when each person or group gives or allows something to the other. 互惠")<sup>互惠</sup> in trade and market access, and to guard against technology transfer. To back this up with a show of limited muscle, France sails at least twice a year through the South China Sea. 

The need for a credible common policy sounds sensible. Trying to forge one is a lot more difficult. Take the construction in Europe of 5G telecoms networks. “You have to grasp the sensitivity of what we’re talking about,” Mr Macron argues, the pitch of his voice rising. Europe, he `laments`<sup>感到遗憾</sup>, has focused its technology policy almost exclusively on market issues, such as roaming or competition, at the expense of strategic thinking. He thinks Europeans should be worried that they cannot guarantee that sensitive technology will be neither Chinese nor American. France is taking a cautious approach to screening investment in its 5G network roll-out. Despite a warning from the head of its own foreign-intelligence service, Germany has taken a less restrictive approach. 

In some matters, the EU may become more willing to act in what Mr Macron considers to be a strategic fashion. The new European Commission could be more `sympathetic`<sup>同意的</sup> to French desires to apply a global measure of market power to evaluate industrial mergers, which would enable pan-European champions to `emerge`<sup>兴起</sup>. The idea of a sales tax on tech firms, which France introduced in July, prompting Mr Trump to tweet angrily about “Macron’s foolishness”, is gaining ground in other countries. France has persuaded Germany to consider the idea of a European carbon border tax. 

The really tough part of Mr Macron’s vision, however, would involve a step change for Europe that is extremely difficult to see happening in a hurry. It would mean converting a bloc that uses the heft of its market to apply rules and standards—and deploys its defence capability primarily for the purposes of crisis management—into one that can project power and act collectively as a military force. “It is very tough,” Mr Macron concedes, acknowledging that “Europe hasn’t demonstrated its credibility yet.” But, he insists, “we’re making progress” and that “attitudes are changing.” 

The French president cites his pet project, the European Intervention Initiative, a coalition of countries (including Britain), ready to act together in crises, as well as the German-favoured EU defence co-operation agreement, known as PESCO. He also points to the hefty new €13bn ($14bn) European Defence Fund to finance research and equipment, and a Franco-German agreement for a joint future-generation tank and fighter plane. All of these, Mr Macron insists, are “designed to be complementary to NATO”. France knows full well from its counter-terrorism operations in the Sahel the depth of its reliance on America. 

But is Europe really ready to undertake such a transformation? “I’ve been hearing about European strategic autonomy for so long,” sighs Philip Gordon of the Council on Foreign Relations, and formerly an adviser to Barack Obama. Part of the problem is defence spending (see chart 2). If Europe’s NATO members are to meet their commitment to spend 2% of GDP on defence by 2024, this would mean spending an extra $102bn—some 40% more than they currently do. 

Tougher still is the need for a change of mindset. Germany remains a defender of [`the status quo`](    "Remember that your enterprise is in the state it is in precisely because of the status quo. "). This is the case on budgetary orthodoxy, which Mr Macron has failed to influence, as well as the post-cold-war order, where he detects some change. Germany is “very unambitious on the world scene, and so a very difficult partner for France,” says Claudia Major, of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, a think-tank. “We constantly feel that [the French] want something from us, and that this is so annoying.” 

Germany is not alone. In other European capitals there is unease at the prospect of French leadership, and a feeling that Mr Macron is all for co-operation, as long as it is on French terms. Such `misgivings`<sup>疑虑</sup> were exposed by his recent veto over the start of accession talks with North Macedonia and Albania. Fellow Europeans `roundly`<sup>严厉地</sup> condemned this as exactly the sort of failure of geostrategic thinking that Mr Macron accuses others of. 

This view `infuriates`<sup>激怒</sup> the president. Enlargement without reform of the EU and of its accession rules, he says, is “absurd”. It prevents Europe from acting as a more integrated bloc. “Half” of the other EU countries agree with him on Albania, he claims, but hide behind France. And he rejects the idea that his veto leaves them vulnerable to rival powers, pointing to growing Russian and Chinese influence in Serbia, which is an accession candidate. If Europe reformed first, says Mr Macron, he would be “ready to open negotiations”. 

Or consider Mr Macron’s Russia policy. He has long argued that rogue powers are more dangerous when isolated. To this end, he has hosted Vladimir Putin at both Versailles, near Paris, and Brégançon, on the Mediterranean. But his call for a “rapprochement” with Russia, in order to keep it out of China’s arms, has alarmed Poland and the Baltics. “My idea is not in the least naive,” argues Mr Macron. He insists that any movement would be conditional on respect for the Minsk peace accords in Ukraine. He has not called for sanctions to be lifted. And he sees this as a long-term strategy, that “might take ten years”. Mr Macron’s belief is that, eventually, Europe will need to try to find common ground with its near neighbour. Not doing so would be “a huge mistake”. 

The rest of the world is still not quite sure what to make of the French president. There is a [`dizzying`](    "You can use dizzying to emphasize that something impresses you, though it makes you a bit confused or unsteady. 令人晕眩的")<sup>令人晕眩的</sup> amount of diplomatic activity now coming out of Paris. This has already led to false hopes, such as the prospect of a Macron-brokered meeting between the Iranians and Americans. Promises of four-way talks between Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany this autumn have yet to materialise. Not unlike Mr Macron’s global `showmanship`<sup>表演技巧</sup> and his `theatrical`<sup>夸张的</sup> handshakes with other world leaders, his foreign policy is generating both interest and [`disquiet`]( "Disquiet is a feeling of worry or anxiety. 忧虑不安")<sup>不安</sup> in almost equal measure. 

It may be that despite all this energetic effort, Mr Macron’s ambitions for “European sovereignty” are frustrated from within by a combination of European divisions, Brexit, German inertia and lingering suspicions of the French. Or that his `imperious`<sup>专横的</sup> behaviour curtails his influence. “Macron has everything in place to build a French-focused Europe,” says Ulrich Speck, of the German Marshall Fund. “Strategically he’s right about so much, but operationally he doesn’t work enough with other partners.” Nor is it even clear that Europe needs to fill its leadership gap. 

Yet, as Mr Macron displayed in China this week, he will seize the mantle if he can. The French president may `<u>overpromise and underdeliver</u>`. But he is `unfazed`<sup>不苦恼
