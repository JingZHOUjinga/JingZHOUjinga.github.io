<h3 id="1.1">Britain’s nightmare before Christmas</h3>

BRITISH VOTERS keep being called to the polls—and each time the options before them are worse. Labour and the Conservatives, once parties of the centre-left and -right, have steadily grown further apart in the three elections of the past four years. Next week voters face their `starkest`<sup>严酷的</sup> choice yet, between Boris Johnson, whose Tories promise a hard Brexit, and Jeremy Corbyn, whose Labour Party plans to “rewrite the rules of the economy” along radical socialist lines. Mr Johnson runs the most unpopular new government on record; Mr Corbyn is the most unpopular leader of the opposition. On Friday the 13th, unlucky Britons will wake to find one of these horrors in charge. 

At the last election, two years and a political era ago, we regretted the drift to the extremes. Today’s manifestos go a lot further. In 2017 Labour was on the left of the European mainstream. Today it would seize 10% of large firms’ equity, to be held in funds paying out mostly to the exchequer rather than to the workers who are meant to be the beneficiaries. It would phase in a four-day week, supposedly with no loss of pay. The list of industries to be nationalised seems only to grow. Drug patents could be forcibly licensed. The bill for a rapid increase in spending would fall on the rich and companies, whose tax burden would go from the lowest in the G7 to the highest. It is an attempt to deal with 21st-century problems using policies that failed in the 20th. 

Nor has Mr Corbyn done anything to dampen concerns about his broader worldview. A critic of Western foreign policy and sympathiser with dictators in Iran and Venezuela who oppose it, he blamed NATO for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2014. Last year he suggested samples of a nerve agent used to poison a Russian former spy in Salisbury should be sent to Moscow, so Vladimir Putin could see if it was his. Under such a prime minister, Britain could not rely on receiving American intelligence. Nor has Mr Corbyn dealt with the anti-Semitism that has taken root in Labour on his watch. Some Remainers might swallow this as the price of a second Brexit referendum, which Mr Corbyn has at last promised. We have long argued for such a vote. Yet Mr Corbyn’s ruinous plans at home and bankrupt views abroad mean that this newspaper cannot support Labour. 

The Conservatives, too, have grown scarier since 2017. Mr Johnson has ditched the Brexit deal negotiated by Theresa May and struck a worse one, in effect lopping off Northern Ireland so that Britain can leave the European Union’s customs union. The public are so sick of the whole fiasco that his promise to “get Brexit done” wins votes. But he would do no such thing (see article). After Britain had left the EU early next year, the hard work of negotiating a trade agreement would begin. Mr Johnson says he would do this by the end of 2020 or leave without one. No-deal is thus still on the table—and a real prospect, since getting a deal in less than a year looks hard. The best estimates suggest that leaving without a deal would make average incomes 8% lower than they would otherwise have been after ten years. 

Brexit is not the only problem with Mr Johnson’s new-look Tories. He has purged moderates and accelerated the shift from an economically and socially liberal party into an economically interventionist and culturally conservative one. Angling for working-class, Leave-voting seats in the north, he has proposed extra state aid, buy-British government procurement and a sketchy tax-and-spending plan that does not add up. Also, he has absorbed the fatal lesson of the Brexit campaign: that there is no penalty for lying or breaking the rules. He promised not to suspend Parliament, then did; he promised not to extend the Brexit talks, then did. This chicanery corrodes trust in democracy. Like Mr Corbyn he has normalised prejudice, by displaying his own and failing to investigate it in his party (both men are thought racist by 30% of voters). For all these reasons this newspaper cannot support the Conservatives. 

That leaves a low bar for the Liberal Democrats, and they clear it. They, too, have become more extreme since we backed them in 2017. Under a new leader, Jo Swinson, they have gone beyond the idea of a second referendum for an irresponsible promise to reverse Brexit unilaterally. This has deservedly backfired. Yet their economic approach—a moderate increase in spending, paid for by broad-based tax increases—is the most sensible of the main parties, and is the only one to be honest about the cost of an ageing society. On climate change and social policy they strike the best balance between ambition and realism. As last time, they are the only choice for anyone who rejects both the hard Brexit of the Conservatives and the hard-left plans of Labour. 

Yet they will not win. So why back them? The practical reason is to restrain whoever ends up in Downing Street. Voters worry that backing the Lib Dems plays into Mr Corbyn’s hands, but our modelling suggests that votes and seats would come fairly evenly from both parties (see Graphic detail). Mr Corbyn is preparing to govern with the Scottish National Party, which would back most of his programme in return for another independence referendum. Having more Lib Dems would check his plans. Likewise, they would rein in Mr Johnson. Some Tories cling to the hope that if he wins a big majority he will drop the populist act and rediscover his liberal instincts. They are deluded. If he wins the Brexit-backing seats he is targeting with his promises of more state aid, do they expect him to switch back to the fantasy of building Singapore-on-Thames? The opposite is true: the bigger the Tory majority, the more drastic the party’s transformation. 

The principled reason is that the Lib Dems are closest to the liberalism on which this newspaper was founded. A strong Lib Dem showing would signal to voters who favour open markets and a liberal society that the centre is alive. The past few years have shown why Parliament needs good people such as Sam Gyimah, who left the Tories because of their extremism, and Chuka Umunna, who left Labour because of theirs. The course of Brexit has been repeatedly changed for the better by independent-minded MPs making the running. If Britain withdraws from the EU in January, the Lib Dem MPs will be among the best advocates of a deep trade deal and the strongest opponents of no-deal. There is no good outcome to this nightmare of an election. But for the centre to hold is the best hope for Britain.

<h3 id="1.2">New troublemakers emerge</h3>

SO MUCH TALK of “crisis” has surrounded NATO’s 70th-birthday year that it has been easy to forget there are reasons to celebrate. Not only has the alliance proved remarkably durable by historical standards, but since 2014 it has responded aptly to Russia’s aggression in Ukraine, refocusing on its core mission of collective defence. It has deployed multinational battlegroups into the three Baltic states and Poland and committed to improved readiness. [`Goaded`](   "If you goad someone, you deliberately make them feel angry or irritated, often causing them to react by doing something. 刺激") by criticism from President Donald Trump, its members have raised their spending on defence. Though many countries, notably Germany, still fall short of their promises, NATO now estimates that between 2016 and 2020 its European members and Canada will `shell out`<sup>付款</sup> an extra $130bn. 

This new money helps explain one welcome development at the meeting of NATO leaders in Britain this week. Mr Trump, previously the disrupter-in-chief, who used to call the organisation “obsolete” and caused consternation at a summit in Brussels in 2018 by threatening to withdraw if Europeans failed to take on a fairer share of the burden, has—however briefly—become a defender. In London this week he blasted President Emmanuel Macron’s criticism of the alliance as “nasty” and “disrespectful”. He made no sign of blocking stern words on Russia or the reiteration of Article Five of NATO’s treaty, the cornerstone of the alliance. America’s commitment will be on display next year, when some 20,000 of its troops are to practise reinforcing Europe in an exercise called Defender 2020. 

The bad news is that other disrupters have emerged. The viscerally anti-NATO Jeremy Corbyn could conceivably become prime minister of one of its leading members after next week’s British general election. Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, has caused consternation by buying a Russian anti-aircraft system, obstructing NATO’s decisions on eastern Europe and invading northern Syria without regard for his allies’ interests. He responded with personal insults to a suggestion by Mr Macron that, given Turkey’s actions in Syria, it might not be able to count on the mutual defence enshrined in Article Five. 

The most surprising troublemaker, and the reason relations have turned ugly, is Mr Macron himself. In a recent interview with The Economist he said that NATO was experiencing “brain-death”. He champions a stronger European defence, which Europe needs, and on December 4th insisted that this would “not be an alternative to NATO but one of its pillars”. But there is lingering suspicion of his intentions among other allies. That is partly because of his enthusiasm for a “strategic dialogue” with Russia. He has emphasised the threat of terrorism over the task of defending against Vladimir Putin’s aggression. Mr Macron is taking a long view and is seeking to stimulate fresh thinking, but most of his allies understandably hear his words as a threat to the progress of the past five years (see article). Russia’s actions, not just in Ukraine but also on NATO territory (including by sending assassins to Salisbury in Britain and, possibly, Berlin’s Tiergarten), call for a strong response. Any desire for concessions will be seen in Moscow as weakness. 

In Britain NATO papered over the cracks. The summit’s declaration affirmed its members’ commitment to Article Five and proclaimed that “Russia’s aggressive actions constitute a threat to Euro-Atlantic security”. That is welcome, but the alliance needs to find a new strategic coherence. Even if Mr Trump remains in favour, America’s focus is shifting ineluctably to its rivalry with China in Asia and beyond. Exercises and increasing readiness will cement the alliance at a military level—and this will endure while the politicians come and go. Work on newish areas such as space and cyberwarfare will help, too. Eventually, a strategic dialogue with Russia might make sense. But to thrive NATO also needs a greater common purpose. Once the [`impetus`](   "Something that gives a process impetus or an impetus makes it happen or progress more quickly. 推动力; 促进因素") came from America. Mr Macron was right to point out that in future Europe will have to play a larger part.

<h3 id="1.3">The necessity of pulling carbon dioxide out of the air</h3>

OF THE WISDOM taught in kindergartens, few `commandments`<sup>戒律</sup> combine moral balance and practical propriety better than the instruction to clear up your own mess. As with messy toddlers, so with planet-spanning civilisations. The industrial nations which are adding alarming amounts of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere—43.1bn tonnes this year, according to a report released this week—will at some point need to go beyond today’s insufficient efforts to stop. They will need to put the world machine into reverse, and start taking carbon dioxide out. They are nowhere near ready to meet this challenge. 

Once such efforts might have been unnecessary. In 1992, at the Rio Earth summit, countries committed themselves to avoiding harmful climate change by reducing greenhouse-gas emissions, with rich countries helping poorer ones develop without exacerbating the problem. Yet almost every year since Rio has seen higher carbon-dioxide emissions than the year before. A staggering 50% of all the carbon dioxide humankind has put into the atmosphere since the Industrial Revolution was added after 1990. And it is this total stock of carbon that matters. The more there is in the atmosphere, the more the climate will shift—though climate lags behind the carbon-dioxide level, just as water in a pan takes time to warm up when you put it on a fire. 

The Paris agreement of 2015 commits its signatories to limiting the rise to 2°C. But as António Guterres, the UN secretary-general, told the nearly 200 countries that attended a meeting in Madrid to hammer out further details of the Paris agreement this week, “our efforts to reach these targets have been utterly inadequate.” 

The world is now 1°C (1.8°F) hotter than it was before the Industrial Revolution. Heatwaves once considered freakish are becoming commonplace. Arctic weather has gone haywire. Sea levels are rising as glaciers melt and ice-sheets thin. Coastlines are subjected to more violent storms and to higher storm surges. The chemistry of the oceans is changing. Barring radical attempts to reduce the amount of incoming sunshine through solar geoengineering, a very [`vexed`]( "A vexed problem or question is very difficult and causes people a lot of trouble. 棘手的") subject, the world will not begin to cool off until carbon-dioxide levels start to fall. 

Considering that the world has yet to get a handle on cutting emissions, focusing on moving to negative emissions—the removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere—might seem premature. But it is already included in many national plans. Some countries, including Britain, have made commitments to move to “net zero” emissions by 2050; this does not mean stopping all emissions for all activities, such as flying and making cement, but taking out as much greenhouse gas as you let loose. 

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates that meeting the 1.5°C goal will mean capturing and storing hundreds of billions of tonnes of carbon dioxide by 2100, with a median estimate of 730bn tonnes—roughly 17 times this year’s carbon-dioxide emissions. In terms of designing, planning and building really large amounts of infrastructure, 2050 is not that far away. That is why methods of providing negative emissions need to be developed right now. 

That raises two problems, one technological, the other psychological. The technological one is that sucking tens of billions of tonnes of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere every year is an enormous undertaking for which the world is not prepared. In principle it is simple to remove carbon dioxide by incorporating it in trees and plants or by capturing it from the flue gas of industrial plants and sequestering it underground. Ingenious new techniques may also be waiting to be discovered. But planting trees on a scale even remotely adequate to the task requires something close to a small continent. And developing the engineering systems to capture large amounts of carbon has been a hard slog, not so much because of scientific difficulties as the lack of incentives (see Briefing). 

The psychological problem is that, even while the capacity to ensure negative emissions languishes underdeveloped, the mere idea that they will one day be possible eats away at the perceived urgency of cutting emissions today. When the 2°C limit was first proposed in the 1990s, it was plausible to imagine that it might be met by emissions cuts alone. The fact that it can still be talked about today is almost entirely thanks to how the models with which climate prognosticators work have been revised to add in the gains from negative emissions. It is a trick that comes `perilously`<sup>危机四伏地</sup> close to magical thinking. 

This puts policymakers in a bind. It would be reckless not to try to develop the technology for negative emissions. But strict limits need to be kept on the tendency to demand more and more of that technology in future scenarios. As at kindergarten, some discipline is necessary. 

The first discipline is to keep in mind whose mess this is. One of the easiest routes to negative emissions is to grow plants. And the world’s cheap land tends to be in poor places. Some of these places would welcome investment in reforestation and afforestation, but they would also need to be able to integrate such endeavours into development plans which reflect their people’s needs. 

The second discipline is for those who talk `blithely`<sup>无忧无虑地</sup> of “net zero”. When they do so, they should be bound to say what level of emissions they envisage, and thus how much negative emitting their pledge commits them to. The stricter they are about its use, the less they are in reality accommodating today’s polluters. 

The third discipline is that governments need to take steps to make negative emissions practicable at scale. In particular, research and incentives are needed to develop and deploy carbon-capture systems for industries, such as cement, that cannot help but produce carbon dioxide. A price on carbon is an essential step if such systems are to be efficient. The trouble is that a price high enough to make capture profitable at this stage in its development would be unfeasibly high. For the time being, therefore, other sticks and carrots will be needed. Governments tend to plead that radical action today is just too hard. And yet those very same governments enthusiastically turn to negative emissions as an easy way to make their climate pledges add up.

<h3 id="1.4">Time for Iraq and Lebanon to ditch state-sponsored sectarianism</h3>

AS MANY ARAB leaders have fallen in the past year as did during the Arab spring. And still the wave of protests over corruption, unemployment and [`threadbare`](   "If you describe an activity, an idea, or an argument as threadbare, you mean that it is very weak, or inadequate, or old and no longer interesting. (活动、想法、论点等)软弱无力的; 陈旧乏味的") public services continues to sweep across the Middle East and north Africa. Turnover at the top has not [`mollified`](    "If you mollify someone, you do or say something to make them less upset or angry. 安抚; 平息") the masses, because rather than producing real change it has reshuffled [`entrenched`]( "If something such as power, a custom, or an idea is entrenched, it is firmly established, so that it would be difficult to change it. 巩固") elites. Particularly in Iraq and Lebanon, many of the protesters now want to tear down entire political systems. It is a dangerous moment. Yet the protesters are right to call for change. 

Both Iraq and Lebanon `divvy`<sup>分配</sup> up power among their religions and sects as a way of keeping the peace between them. Lebanon constructed a sectarian political system long before the civil war of 1975-90, and buttressed it afterwards. Iraq’s system was set up in 2003, after America’s invasion. It did not prevent Sunnis from fighting Shias. But the civil war is over in Iraq, as in Lebanon. It would seem risky to upset these fragile arrangements. 

Leaving them be would be even riskier. Start with Iraq, where America aimed to satisfy all groups but instead created a system that encourages patronage and empowers political parties (and militias) which entrench the country’s ethnic and sectarian divisions. It is difficult to get ahead in Iraqi politics—or indeed in life—without associating with one of these parties. They treat ministries like cash machines and hand out government jobs based on loyalty, not merit. Many people depend on them for access to health care, education or a salary. Hence politicians long ago exposed as corrupt and incompetent can remain in power. 

The situation is similar in Lebanon, where the warlords who razed the country became politicians who loot it. The government has racked up huge debts to fund Sunni, Shia and Christian patronage schemes. The World Bank estimates that the waste associated with the power-sharing system costs Lebanon 9% of GDP each year. The government cannot even keep the lights on. Or perhaps it does not want to, since the businessmen who sell generators are often connected to sectarian leaders. With a financial crisis looming, Lebanon must restructure its debt and introduce reforms. Its leaders seem incapable of doing so. 

Sectarian government is not only ineffective—it is also unrepresentative. Lebanon has not held a census since 1932, but The Economist obtained voter-registration lists from 2016. They show that the allotment of parliamentary seats to each religion does not match the share of voters from each faith. Polls show that Iraqis have lost trust in religious parties and leaders. Many people in both countries, especially the young, appear to be losing their personal faith, too (see article). 

The people of Iraq and Lebanon deserve political systems that do more to reflect their views and represent their interests. That means unpicking state-backed sectarianism. Increased transparency would help expose the worst patronage schemes; stronger institutions might curb them. Militias should be brought under the official chain of command. If Lebanon stopped forcing candidates to compete for seats that are allocated by religion, more might run on secular platforms, not sectarian ones. In Iraq the electoral law helps entrench big parties, while the electoral commission caters to elites. Both need reform. 

Such steps may not satisfy the protesters. And they will be resisted by vested interests and their foreign supporters. Hizbullah, a Shia militia-cum-political party in Lebanon, and the Shia militias of Iraq thrive under today’s system and fear being constrained. They are backed by Iran, which uses them to extend its influence. But Iran has also been rocked by big protests. The lesson for it is the same. Reform a political system that has failed the people, or risk seeing it come crashing down.

<h3 id="1.5">Who will control Alphabet once Sergey Brin and Larry Page are gone?</h3>

“YEAH, OK, WHY not? I’ll just give it a try.” With those words Sergey Brin abandoned academia and poured his energy into Google, a new firm he had dreamed up with a friend, Larry Page. Incorporated in 1998, it developed PageRank, a way of cataloguing the [`burgeoning`](  "If something burgeons, it grows or develops rapidly. 迅速生长") world wide web. Some 21 years on, Messrs Brin and Page are retiring from a giant that dominates the search business. Alphabet, as their firm is now known, is the world’s fourth-most-valuable listed company (see article), worth $910bn. In spite of its [`conspicuous`](    "If someone or something is conspicuous, people can see or notice them very easily. 显眼的") success, they leave it facing three uncomfortable questions—about its strategy, its role in society and who is really in control. 

Silicon Valley has always featured entrepreneurs making giant leaps. Even by those standards Google jumped far, fast. From the start its search engine enjoyed a virtuous circle—the more people use it and the more data it collects, the more useful it becomes. The business model, in which advertisers pay to get the attention of users around the world, has printed money. It took Google just eight years to reach $10bn in annual sales. Its peak cumulative losses were $21m. By comparison, Uber has [`incinerated`](   "When authorities incinerate rubbish or waste material, they burn it completely in a special container. 把…烧成灰烬") $15bn and still loses money. 

Today Alphabet is in rude health in many respects. Its search engine has billions of users, who find it one of the most useful tools in their lives. One recent study found that the typical user would need to be paid $17,530 to agree to forfeit access to a search engine for a year, compared with $322 for social-media sites, such as Facebook. Alphabet cranks out colossal profits. Many pretenders have tried to mimic the Google approach of having a vast customer base and exploring network effects. Only a few, including Facebook, have succeeded at such a scale. 

There are uncertainties, however. Take strategy first. Other tech giants have diversified away from their core business—Amazon began in e-commerce, for example, but is now big in cloud-computing. In China Tencent has shifted from video games to a huge array of services. Alphabet has not stood still: it bought YouTube in 2006 and shifted to mobile by launching Android, an operating system, in 2007. But it still makes 85% of its sales from search-advertising. A big bet on driverless cars has yet to pay off. As the firm matures, it should start paying a dividend. 

The second question is how closely the company might end up being regulated. Alphabet’s monopoly in the search business has led to worries that it may squeeze other firms unfairly. Its huge store of data raises privacy concerns. And because it is a conduit for information and news, its influence over politics has come under ever more scrutiny. All this augurs much tighter regulation. Alphabet has already paid or been subject to $9bn in fines in the EU, and in America politicians on both sides of the aisle support tighter rules or, in some cases, a break-up. If it were to be regulated like a utility, profits could fall sharply. 

The last question is who will be in control. Messrs Page and Brin famously sought “parental supervision” in 2001 and hired an external chief executive. Both founders will now [`relinquish`](  "If you relinquish something such as power or control, you give it up. 放弃 (权力或控制)") any executive role, handing the reins to Sundar Pichai, a company [`stalwart`](  "A stalwart is a loyal worker or supporter of an organization, especially a political party. (尤指某政党的) 忠实拥护者"). Yet dual-class shares mean they will still control over 50% of the firm’s voting rights. This structure is popular in Silicon Valley. But there is little evidence that it ages well. Of today’s digital giants, two have so far faced succession—Microsoft and Apple. They have prospered partly because their founders or their families did not retain voting control after they left the scene. Alphabet’s founders should forfeit their special voting rights and gradually sell their shares. Their firm faces deep questions—best to give someone else the freedom to answer them.

<h3 id="2.1">Climate policy needs negative carbon-dioxide emissions</h3>

ON ONE SIDE of a utility road at the edge of Drax power station in Yorkshire sits a vast pile of deep black coal. On the other side, trains loaded to the brim with compressed wood pellets. “The old and the new,” says a worker. 

Opened just under half a century ago, Drax (pictured) was not only the biggest coal-fired power station ever built in Britain: it was the last. Now only two of its six mighty boilers are still fired by coal, and at the end of November they had sat idle since March. In the first half of 2019, coal accounted for just 6% of Drax’s electricity output. The rest came from those wood pellets. Biomass burned at Drax provides 11% of Britain’s renewable electricity—roughly the same amount as all the country’s solar panels combined. 

And soon Drax—the power plant is owned by a company of the same name—hopes to be more than an electricity supplier. It hopes to be a carbon remover. By pumping the CO2 it produces from its pellets into [`subterranean`]( "A subterranean river or tunnel is under the ground. 地下的") geological storage, rather than returning it to the atmosphere, it hopes to pioneer a process which climate policymakers see as vital: so-called “negative emissions”. 

The Paris climate agreement of 2015 calls for the Earth’s temperature to increase by no more than 2°C over pre-industrial levels, and ideally by as little as 1.5°C. Already, temperatures are 1°C above the pre-industrial, and they continue to climb, driven for the most part by CO2 emissions of 43bn tonnes a year. To stand a good chance of scraping under the 2°C target, let alone the 1.5°C target, just by curtailing greenhouse-gas emissions would require cuts far more stringent than the large emitting nations are currently offering. 

Recognising this, the agreement envisages a future in which, as well as hugely reducing the amount of CO2 put into the atmosphere, nations also take a fair bit out. Scenarios looked at by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) last year required between 100bn and 1trn tonnes of CO2 to be removed from the atmosphere by the end of the century if the Paris goals were to be reached; the median value was 730bn tonnes–that is, more than ten years of global emissions. 

This is where what is going on at Drax comes in. Plants and algae have been sucking carbon out of the atmosphere and turning it into biomass for over a billion years. It is because the carbon in biomass was, until recently, in the atmosphere that burning it in a power station like Drax counts as renewable energy; it just puts back into the atmosphere what the plants took out. The emissions from procuring and transporting the biomass matter too, but if the supply chain is well managed they should be quite small in comparison. The pellets at Drax are mostly made from `sawmill`<sup>锯木厂</sup> refuse and other by-products in America; they are then transported by rail, ship and rail to the site where they will be `pulverised`<sup>粉碎</sup> and burned. 

If, instead of burning the biomass, you just let it stand, the carbon stays put. So if you increase the amount of vegetation on the planet, you can suck down a certain amount of the excess CO2 from the atmosphere. Growing forests, or improving farmland, is often a good idea for other reasons, and can certainly store some carbon. But it is not a particularly reliable way of doing so. Forests can be cut back down, or burned—and they might also die off if, overall, mitigation efforts fail to keep the climate cool enough for their liking. 

But the biggest problem with using new or restored forests as carbon stores is how big they have to be to make a serious difference. The area covered by new or restored forests in some of the IPCC scenarios was the size of Russia. And even such a heroic Johnny Appleseeding would only absorb on the order of 200bn tonnes of CO2 ; less than many consider necessary. 

The sort of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) power station that Drax wants to turn itself into would allow more carbon to be captured on the same amount of land. The trick is to use the biomass not as a simple standing store of carbon, but as a renewable fuel. 

The original use envisaged for carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology was to take CO2 out of the chimneys of coal-fired power plants and pump it deep underground; do it right and the power station will be close to carbon-neutral. Apply the same technology to a biomass-burning plant and the CO2 you pump into the depths is not from ancient fossils, but from recently living plants—and, before them, the atmosphere. Hey presto: negative emissions. And BECCS does not just get rid of CO2: it produces power, too. The solar energy that photosynthesis stored away in the plants’ leaves and wood gets turned into electricity when that biomass is burned. It is almost as if nature were paying to get rid of the stuff. 

There are, as you might expect, some difficulties. Even if you regularly take some away for burning, growing biomass on the requisite scale still takes a lot of land. Also, the bog-standard CCS of which BECCS is meant to be a clever variant has never really made its mark. It has been talked about for decades; the IPCC produced a report about it in 2005. Some hoped that it might become a mainstay of carbon-free energy production. But for various reasons, technical, economic and ideological, it has not. 

The world has about 2,500 coal-fired power stations, and thousands more gas-fired stations, steel plants, cement works and other installations that produce industrial amounts of CO2. Just 19 of them offer some level of CCS, according to the Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute (GCCSI), a CCS advocacy group. All told, roughly 40m tonnes of CO2 are being captured from industrial sources every year—around 0.1% of emissions. 

Why so little? There are no fundamental technological hurdles; but the heavy industrial kit needed to do CCS at scale costs a lot. If CO2 emitters had to pay for the privilege of emitting to the tune, say, of $100 a tonne, there would be a lot more interest in the technology, which would bring down its cost. In the absence of such a price, there are very few incentives or penalties to encourage such investment. The greens who lobby for action on the climate do not, for the most part, want to support CCS. They see it as a way for fossil-fuel companies to seem to be part of the solution while staying in business, a prospect they hate. Electricity generators have seen the remarkable drop in the price of wind and solar and invested accordingly. 

Thus Drax’s CCS facility remains, at the moment, a pair of grey shipping containers sitting in a fenced-off area outside the main boiler hall, dwarfed by the vast buildings and pipes that surround them. Inside the first container, the flue gases—which are about 10% CO2 by volume—are run through a solvent which binds avidly to CO2 molecules. The carbon-laden solvent is then pumped into the second container, where it is heated—which causes it to give up its burden, now a pure gas. 

This test rig produces just one tonne of CO2 a day. The pipe through which the flue gases enter it is perhaps 30cm across. High above it is another pipe, now unused, which in coal-burning days took all the flue gases to a system that would strip sulphur from them. It is big enough that you could drive down it in a double-decker bus with another double-decker on top. That is the pipe that Drax would like to be able to invest in using. 

In some circumstances, you do not need a subsidy, a carbon price or any other intervention to make capturing CO2 pay. Selling it will suffice. The commercial use of CO2 is nothing new. Not long after the great British chemist Joseph Priestley first made what he called “fixed air” in the 1760s, an ingenious businessman called Johann Jacob Schweppe was selling soda water in Geneva. CO2, mostly from natural sources, is still used to make drinks fizzy and for other things. Many greenhouses make use of it to stimulate the growth of plants. 

The problem with most of these markets from a negative-emissions point of view is that the CO2 gets back into the atmosphere in not much more time than it takes a drinker to belch. But there is one notable exception. For half a century oil companies have been squirting CO2 down some of their wells in order to chase recalcitrant oil out of the nooks and crannies in the rock—a process known as enhanced oil recovery, or EOR. And though the oil comes out, a lot of the CO2 stays underground. 

The oil industry goes to some inconvenience to capture the 28m tonnes of CO2 a year it uses for EOR from natural sources (some gas wells have a lot of CO2 mixed in with the good stuff). That effort is rewarded, according to the International Energy Agency, with some 500,000 barrels of oil a day, or 0.6% of global production. That seems like a market that CCS could grow into—though the irony of using CO2 produced by burning fossil fuels to chase yet more fossil fuels out of the ground is not lost on anyone. 

The fact that oilfields in Texas regularly use EOR has made the state a popular site for companies trying out new approaches to carbon capture. A startup called NET Power has built a new sort of gas-fired power plant on the outskirts of Houston. Most such plants burn natural gas in air to heat water to make steam to drive a turbine. The NET Power plant burns natural gas in pure oxygen to create a stream of hot CO2 which drives the turbine directly—and which, being pure, needs no further filtering in order to be used for EOR. 

Also in Texas, Occidental Petroleum is developing a plant with Carbon Engineering, a Canadian firm which seeks to pull CO2 straight out of the air, a process called direct air capture. Because CO2 is present in air only at a very low concentration (0.04%) DAC is a very demanding business. But oil recovered through EOR that uses atmospheric CO2 can earn handsome credits under California’s Low-Carbon Fuel Standards cap and trade programme. The scheme aims to be pumping 500,000 tonnes of CO2 captured from the air into Occidental’s nearly depleted wells by 2022. 

Not all the CO2 pumped into the ground by oil companies is used for EOR. Equinor, formerly Statoil, a Norwegian oil company, has long pumped CO2 into a spent field in the North Sea, both to prove the technology and to avoid the stiff carbon tax which Norway levies on emissions from the hydrocarbon industry. As a condition on its lease to develop the Gorgon natural-gas field off the coast of Australia, Chevron was required to strip the CO2 out of the gas and store it. The resultant project is, at 4m tonnes a year, bigger than any other not used for EOR, and the world’s only CCS facility that could handle emissions on the scale of those from Drax. 

In Europe, the idea has caught on that the costs of operating big CO2 reservoirs like Gorgon’s will need to be shared between many carbon sources. This is prompting a trend towards clusters that could share the storage infrastructure. Equinor, Shell and Total, two more oil companies, are proposing to turn CCS into a service industry in Norway. For a fee they will collect CO2 from its producers and ship it to Bergen before pushing it out through a pipeline to offshore injection points. In September Equinor announced that it had seven potential customers, including Air Liquide, an industrial-gas provider, and ArcelorMittal, a steelmaker. 

Similar projects for filling up the emptied gasfields of the North Sea are seeking government support in the Netherlands, where Rotterdam’s port authority is championing the idea, and in Britain, where the main movers are heavy industries in the north, including Drax. 

This is part of what the GCCSI says is a steady increase in projects to capture and store, or use, CO2. But the trend needs to be treated with caution. First and foremost, global carbon capture is still measured in the tens of millions of tonnes, not the billions of tonnes that matter to the climate. What the Gorgon project stores in a year, the world emits in an hour. 

Second, the public support the sector has received in the past has often proved fickle or poorly designed. In 2012, the British government promised £1bn in funding for CCS, only to pull the plug in 2015. Two projects which had been competing for the money, a Scottish one that would have trapped CO2 at an existing gas plant and one in Yorkshire which planned to build a new coal-fired power station with CCS, were both scrapped. This history makes the £800m for CCS that Boris Johnson, the prime minister, has promised as part of the current election campaign even less convincing than most such pledges. 

But there are some reasons for optimism. In 2008 America enacted a tax credit, 45Q, that was to reward the first 75m tonnes of CO2 sequestered through CCS. Unfortunately, not knowing from the outset whether a given project would end up emitting the lucrative 74th-millionth tonne or the otiose 76th-millionth tonne tempered investor enthusiasm. Last year 45Q was amended. Instead of a 75m tonne cap, there is now a time limit: all projects that are up and running before January 1st 2024 will be eligible. This has created a flurry of activity. 

The European Union has also recently announced financial support for CCS, in the form of a roughly €10bn innovation fund aimed at CCS, renewables and energy storage. The first call for projects goes out in 2020. Christian Holzleitner, head of the EU’s Directorate-General for Climate Action, emphasises that the fund’s purpose is not to decarbonise fossil-fuel energy, but rather to focus on CCS development for the difficult-to-decarbonise industries such as steel and cement. With renewables on a roll, that makes a lot of sense. 

Tax breaks, experimental capture plants, new fangled ways of producing electricity and talk of infrastructure hubs amount to an encouraging buzz, but not yet much more. A CCS industry capable of producing lots of BECCS plants remains a long way off, as does the infrastructure for gathering sustainably sourced biomass for use in them. Carbon Engineering and its rival DAC companies, such as Climeworks and Skytree, remain very expensive ways of getting pure CO2. If they can find new markets and push their costs down both by learning better tricks and through economies of scale, they may yet be part of the solution. But for now, it looks like most of the CO2 being pumped into the atmosphere will stay there for a very long time.

<h3 id="3.1">America seeks faster ways to launch military satellites</h3>

BY SHOOTING A missile into one of its own satellites in March, India upped the ante. The immediate intention, suggests Jeffrey Caton, a retired American air-force colonel who teaches at the Army War College, was to fire “a shot across the bow” of India’s rival China. The Chinese had, after all, blown up one of their own satellites in 2007, in a similar demonstration of their ability to do such things. India’s test, along with the wider [`profusion`](  "If there is a profusion of something or if it occurs in profusion, there is a very large quantity or variety of it. 大量; 丰富") of anti-satellite weapons, has lent credence to the worries of defence chiefs around the world who believe that future conflicts between great powers will stretch into space. 

Satellites are too militarily useful to pretend that [`adversaries`](   "Your adversary is someone you are competing with, or arguing or fighting against. 对手") will consider them off-limits, says William Roper, the air force’s assistant secretary for technology and acquisitions. America must therefore ready itself for warfare in space. America is, indeed, especially vulnerable. It has more space assets than any other country and relies on them more for its war-fighting capability. Moreover, as John Hyten, the vice-chairman of America’s Joint Chiefs of Staff, eloquently puts it, America’s kit in space consists mainly of large, “exquisite” satellites that make for “big, fat, juicy targets”. 

One approach to reducing the risk this poses is to make those targets less fat and juicy. That is happening, as both civil and military satellite users shrink their hardware and scatter its functions over multiple pieces of equipment. In particular, people are deploying more of the modular designs known as cubesats. Among other things, that means individual satellites are smaller and cheaper, and therefore easier to stockpile in advance. But for this approach to be really useful, it must also be possible to launch them quickly if, for whatever reason (whether enemy action or otherwise), an orbiting asset stops working and needs replacing. 

That concept is known as “responsive space”, and, in today’s outsourced world, it often means calling on the private sector to do the actual launching. American officials are therefore pleased that a firm called Rocket Lab, whose services they often rely on for lifting payloads of up to 150kg, has quickened the tempo of cubesat launches from its pad in New Zealand to once a month. Rocket Lab hopes that, by early next year, it will have improved this rate to once a `fortnight`<sup>两星期</sup>—an objective which will be assisted by its construction of a second launch pad in Virginia. 

Rocket Lab is also a pioneer of the 3D printing of rocket parts, such as the nozzles, valves, pumps and main [`combustion`](    "Combustion is the act of burning something or the process of burning. 燃烧") chamber of the motor. That reduces the number of components involved, and greatly speeds up manufacture and assembly. Rockets being expensive, no one wants to carry a large inventory of them. Having a “just in time” approach to launcher availability is therefore desirable. 

Relativity Space, another American firm, also plans to print its rocket, the Terran 1. This will carry a payload of 900kg. Its first orbital launch is scheduled for next year. Relativity Space’s biggest printers produce five-metre sections of propellant tank. Its most precise ones create engine parts with an accuracy of 40 millionths of a metre. A conventionally manufactured rocket of similar size would contain, the firm says, nearly 100,000 parts. Terran 1 has less than 1,000. That simplifies the supply chain and accelerates the testing of parts. 

Speeding up launcher production in this way helps. But it will not be enough if America is to fulfil its goal of launching replacement satellites with a day’s notice. That is one reason, says Mr Roper, why the air force is now buying, at a series of pitching events that started in March, ideas for ways of [`prevailing`](  "The prevailing wind in an area is the type of wind that blows over that area most of the time. (风)盛行的") in “high end” orbital combat. Encouragingly for proposers of such ideas, little bureaucracy is involved. Settlement for those accepted is immediate—the air force sidesteps its lumbering payments system by using official credit cards to transfer money instantly to people’s PayPal accounts. Those who present clever proposals can thus pocket awards exceeding $100,000 within minutes. The latest of these pitching meetings, on November 5th and 6th, resulted in [`on-the-spot`](    "On-the-spot things are done immediately and at the place where you are. 当场的") contracts worth $22.5m. 

Meanwhile DARPA, America’s main military-research organisation, is trying to organise a responsive-space competition of its own. Next year it hopes to hold a challenge in which teams will attempt launches twice in a matter of days or weeks, each time learning only shortly [`beforehand`](    "If you do something beforehand, you do it earlier than a particular event. 事先; 预先") of the mission’s location, destination orbit and payload characteristics. This has never been done before. Programming the computers takes time, and the rocket must be trimmed in advance for the particular trajectory, taking into account such factors as the weather. Prizes of up to $10m will be awarded. 

It is a measure of the task’s difficulty that, of the 55 teams which signed up initially, only three qualified, and two have subsequently dropped out. The name of the remaining competitor is secret. 

At least one of the dropouts has not given up completely, though. That firm, Virgin Orbit, has turned a Boeing 747-400 into a flying launch pad. At an altitude of about 10.7km, the aircraft releases a rocket called LauncherOne. This rocket’s engine ignites after 4.8 seconds of freefall. 

Such launches, Virgin Orbit says, can take place above nasty weather. They also make it easier to reach east-to-west “retrograde” orbits, because the launching plane can fly in the opposite direction to Earth’s spin, reducing the launch velocity required for such an orbit. Though Virgin Orbit’s system has yet to put a satellite into orbit, Britain’s Royal Air Force seems interested. In July it announced a deal to launch small satellites on notices possibly as short as a week. By today’s standards, that is, indeed, pretty responsive.

<h3 id="3.2">Even aggressive centipedes will co-operate if they have to</h3>


CENTIPEDES DO NOT generally get on well together. Even members of the same species may attack one another when they meet. So it is a surprise to find mother centipedes sharing nests and a double surprise to find that those co-residents are sometimes not even conspecifics. This, though, is the conclusion of research published in Biotropica by Farnon Ellwood and Josie Phillips of the University of the West of England, in Bristol. 

Dr Ellwood studies the invertebrates of the Danum Valley, an area of rainforest in Sabah, a Malaysian state in north Borneo. His past expeditions have found lots of centipedes living in epiphytes called bird’s nest ferns. These ferns tolerate the low [`illumination`](    "Illumination is the lighting that a place has. 照明") beneath a forest’s light-absorbing canopy and may weigh more than 200kg. They and their inhabitants are hard to investigate because they grow on tree trunks dozens of metres above the ground. But when Dr Ellwood did bring a few down to [`terra firma`]( "If you describe the ground as terra firma, you mean that it feels safe in contrast to being in the air or at sea. 陆地") he found that the largest of them contained, besides the `plethora`<sup>过剩</sup> of herbivorous insects he was expecting, 126 centipedes. That led him to wonder whether, rather than migrating from the ground as he had previously assumed was the origin of such myriapods in tree tops, the creatures were actually being born there. 

To investigate the matter he and Ms Phillips collaborated with colleagues from Sabah’s Forestry Department and the Natural History Museum, in London, to set up climbing lines in local trees and use them to collect bird’s nest ferns. Each `specimen`<sup>样品</sup> was, as it broke loose from the tree, decanted straight into a clear plastic bag to stop its centipede inhabitants escaping. It was then lowered to the ground using pulleys. In total, the researchers nabbed 44 ferns in this way—half from the highest part of the canopy, above 40 metres, and the rest from above 20 metres. Once a fern was safely landed they dissected it and dropped every centipede found into a solution of ethanol, to kill and preserve it. Also, before themselves descending the trees, the collectors put data loggers into some of the ferns they had left in place, to measure the temperature within and outside the plants. 

It quickly became apparent, when the researchers began pulling the ferns apart, that some of them contained centipede nurseries. Deep inside they discovered special chambers that the creatures had made by chewing through the fern’s inner roots. Here, mother centipedes were curled protectively around clutches of eggs or juveniles. The team found ten such nests. And three of them were shared by females of different species. 

Maternal behaviour by tropical centipedes is not unknown. In particular, females will hang around to keep eggs and newly hatched larvae clean, to stop fungal infestations developing on them. They also bring prey for the youngsters to feed on. Tolerating nest mates, though, is a different matter. Dr Ellwood and Ms Phillips reckon that this curious behaviour is driven by matters climatic. 

The climate in question is not, however, that of the rainforest as a whole. Rather, it is the microclimate inside a fern itself. The data loggers left behind by the fern collectors showed that during the hottest part of the day the temperature inside a fern is as much as 6°C lower than that outside. Dr Ellwood suspects this heat-shielding makes ferns attractive places for centipedes to raise their heat-sensitive young—and that the limited space available inside a fern has caused natural selection to put mother centipedes’ aggressive instincts on hold and make them considerably more tolerant of one another’s company when nesting than might otherwise be the case.

<h3 id="3.3">If aircraft can copy the way geese fly, they will save fuel</h3>

IN THE CUT-THROAT business of civil aviation, every little helps. So researchers at Airbus, Europe’s biggest aircraft manufacturer, have been experimenting with a wheeze which they hope might shave up to 10% off an airliner’s fuel consumption. This is to hitch a ride on the wake of the plane in front. 

It is a familiar idea. Evolution blundered across it millions of years ago, and it explains why skeins of geese, swans and so on adopt a V-shaped formation when flying in groups. `Vortices`<sup>旋涡</sup> of air shed from the tips of a bird’s wings represent wasted effort. But that effort can be captured as lift by another bird trailing at the correct distance and angle. 

Aeronautical engineers have long dreamed of flying platoons of planes in a similar way, with trailing aircraft surfing the wakes of those leading the [`convoy`](   "A convoy is a group of vehicles or ships travelling together. 同行的船队; 同行的车队"). The problem is catching the supportive updraft at one side of a vortex rather than the turbulence-inducing downdraft on the other side—and doing so far enough from the vortex’s powerful core to ride it safely and without spilling the passengers’ drinks. 

Airbus’s researchers, under the aegis of Sandra Bour Schaeffer, head of Airbus Group Demonstrators, have been trying to work out the details by flying a series of tests in which an A350-900 follows in the wake of an A380, both having been loaded with ballast to simulate the weight of passengers and cargo. To do this, the test pilots needed a way to see the vortices’ cores, in order to avoid steering into them—which would risk crashing the plane. Early experiments used smoke to make vortices visible. This approach was then replaced with lidars (the optical equivalent of radars). Using these, Airbus’s researchers were able to measure the shape of a vortex at different distances behind the leading aircraft. 

The trailing pilots then proceeded, in careful stages, to approach closer and closer to the outer portion of the wake, while engineers in the back of the plane crunched data such as fuel consumption and the speed and accelerations of the two aircraft. Early in the tests, in 2016, over southern France, the team observed that by positioning the trailing aircraft at a particular distance—a “sweet spot”—the ride would be especially smooth, with the fuel-burn reduced by more than 10%. 

This sweet spot, they found, is between one and a half and three kilometres behind the leader, and slightly to its side. Since the vortex shape and position change with altitude and temperature, as well as the velocity and weight of the leading aeroplane, so does the location of the sweet spot. 

Working out how to incorporate all this into an aircraft’s autopilot will take a while. Ms Bour Schaeffer hopes to run further tests next year and then, in 2021, to extend these to involve a pair of commercial airlines. The biggest obstacle, if those tests prove satisfactory, will be gaining the approval of air-traffic controllers and regulators. At a typical cruising speed a distance of two or three kilometres takes only a few seconds for a plane to cover, and the idea of flying that close for long distances has raised eyebrows among both pilots and engineers. Flight-control and precision-navigation technology are, though, getting better and better. And regulators may also wish to take into account the disfavour the air-travel industry is experiencing as a result of the carbon dioxide it is adding to the atmosphere. Saving fuel not only saves money, it also saves CO2.

<h3 id="3.4">Malaria infections have stopped falling</h3>

AFEW YEARS ago it looked as if malaria might be on the way out. From 2000 to 2014 the number of cases and deaths fell. As the World Health Organisation’s annual report on the disease shows, though, the decline in cases has ended (see chart) and that in deaths has slowed. The report, published on December 4th, says there were 228m cases of malaria in 2018, which resulted in 400,000 deaths. Most victims were young children in Africa. That is a far cry from targets set in 2015 for the near-elimination of malaria by 2030. 

That strategy of elimination had counted on $6bn a year being poured into malaria-control efforts. Funding in recent years, however, has been about $3bn a year. More money would surely help. But substantial gains can be made by doing things more efficiently—something at which malaria programmes have been dismal. 

Stopping malaria relies on three things: insecticide-treated bed nets to prevent [`nocturnal`]( "Nocturnal means occurring at night. 夜间发生的") mosquito bites; the spraying of homes with insecticides; and the treating of pregnant women and children with rounds of preventive medication. These are all “imperfect tools, often used imperfectly”, says Pedro Alonso, head of the malaria programme at the World Health Organisation. Countries usually deploy the same package of measures everywhere, even though infection rates and their seasonal patterns vary a lot between regions, and particularly between cities and the countryside. Transmission reaches a peak in the rainy season, when mosquitoes are abundant, so preventive mass-treatment of children then can make a huge difference. Regional variations are particularly [`pronounced`](   "Something that is pronounced is very noticeable. 明显的") in large countries like Nigeria—a place that, by itself, accounts for a quarter of the world’s malaria cases. 

The typical approach of a malaria-control programme is to bombard a country with bed nets and then use whatever cash remains for sporadic rounds of preventive medication. But in many big cities, such as Dar es Salaam and Nairobi, cases are few and far between, so deploying nets there is a waste. Overspending on nets at the expense of other things happens partly because nets are easy to count—a feature that aid programmes are particularly fond of. Results which cannot be attributed directly to money a donor spends tend to fall further down that donor’s list of priorities. This kind of reasoning tips the scales, because foreign aid accounts for two-thirds of the money spent on malaria. 

Another problem is patchy data about local disease patterns. This makes it tricky to work out the best mix of malaria-control measures for a given area—and when to deploy them. Still, it is better to use whatever figures are available, because that will initiate a virtuous circle, says Dr Alonso. As things stand, local health workers responsible for collecting such data often do a [`sloppy`]( "If you describe someone's work or activities as sloppy, you mean they have been done in a careless and lazy way. 慵懒的; 马虎的") job because they do not see the data being put to use. 

Such things matter. The two countries that stand out as successes in this year’s report are India and Uganda. Both report dramatic falls in cases of malaria between 2017 and 2018. Not coincidentally, both have been busy fine-tuning their regional malaria-prevention strategies. If other countries followed suit, the world might get back on track to beating the disease.

<h3 id="3.5">Some planks from ancient Rome started life in eastern France</h3>

THESE OAK planks, once part of the portico of a property just outside Imperial Rome, travelled a long way before the builders got their hands on them. The science of dating trees by looking at their growth rings is now so good that Mauro Bernabei of Italy’s National Research Council and his colleagues were able to say, in a paper just published in PLOS One, where the trees that provided the planks had grown, and when they were cut. Rings’ thicknesses are affected by the local climate. Comparison with samples of known origin showed that the trees grew in what is now eastern France, and were `felled`<sup>砍伐</sup> between 40 and 60AD. That speaks of a sophisticated timber trade, which floated the logs down the Saône and Rhône to the Mediterranean, and thence to the Eternal City.

<h3 id="3.6">The first computer chip with a trillion transistors</h3>

SILICON CHIPS have lonely lives. They are born together, often as tens of thousands of identical siblings a few millimetres across, on a single wafer the size of an old-fashioned vinyl record. They are then broken from their natal wafers like squares of chocolate from a bar, and packaged individually in plastic and metal. Only after this is a chip reconnected to others of its kind, as the packages are wired up to work together on circuit boards and inserted into products. 

Many inventors over the years have noted that if chips were instead wired together from the beginning, on the wafer itself, much expense and trouble would be avoided. But efforts to implement such wafer-scale integration have consistently failed, either because the technology just did not work or the resulting circuits could not compete with new versions of conventional designs. 

Now Cerebras, a firm in Los Altos, California, thinks the time is right to try again. The heart of its new product, a supercomputer called the CS-1, could hardly be described as a “chip”. It is a slab of silicon measuring 21.5cm by 21.5cm that the firm refers to as a wafer-scale engine. But whatever name you give it, it is a record-breaker. A high-end modern computer chip might have billions of transistors on its surface. The wafer-scale engine has more than a trillion of them. 

Cerebras’s creation breaks many records besides the trillion-transistor barrier (it actually has 1.2trn). Its transistors are organised into 400,000 individual processing units, known in the trade as cores, and it can shuttle nine petabytes (9,000trn bytes) of data per second around inside itself. For comparison, Intel’s i9-9900k chips, typical of those found in modern PCs, have a mere eight cores and can shuttle 40 gigabytes per second. 

The CS-1 has some notably small numbers, too. Admittedly, IBM’s Summit supercomputer, among the `snazziest`<sup>时髦的</sup> in the unclassified world, offers some 2.4m cores. However, Summit is constructed conventionally, using package-laden circuit boards. It weighs over 340 tonnes and occupies 520 square metres of floor space. A CS-1 weighs around 250kg and is the size of a domestic refrigerator. It also consumes a mere 15-20kW of electricity. Summit requires 1,000 times as much. 

The purpose of all this computational heft is to run linear algebra, the mathematics of data processing in general and machine learning in particular. Machine learning is at the heart of the trendy and [`lucrative`](    "A lucrative activity, job, or business deal is very profitable. 获利丰厚的") field of computing branded “artificial intelligence”. 

The CS-1’s compiler—the software that turns programs written by human beings into binary code which a computer can understand—is tuned to keep the flow of data from core to core as efficient as possible. It does this by matching the structure of the code generated to that of the hardware. Also, as the cores are positioned within fractions of a millimetre of the memory they use, that flow of data is already much faster from one part of a circuit board to another than the long-distance trip which would normally be required. 

The wafer-scale engines themselves are made by TSMC, a Taiwanese firm, using a process claimed to be so accurate that each has just 150-200 defects. These are easily worked around, given the number of other transistors available. Wafer-scale integration has many other challenges, such as keeping everything synchronised, pumping in enough electric power, pumping out the resultant heat, and efficiently moving gigabytes of data to and from other parts of a machine. But if the CS-1 survives contact with the real world of commercial use, then wafer-scale integration will at last have proved itself, and the days of the lonely chip may be numbered.

<h3 id="4.1">Business this week</h3>

In an unexpected move, Sergey Brin and Larry Page stepped down from their respective roles as president and chief executive of Alphabet, Google’s parent company. The pair founded the internet giant in a garage while at Stanford in 1998. They will retain their combined voting majority in the company and continue to sit on the board. Sundar Pichai becomes Alphabet’s chief executive in addition to his job running Google, expanding his brief to oversee “moonshot” projects, such as driverless cars and electricity-generating kites. Messrs Brin and Page assured Mr Pichai they would still be around to offer “advice and love, but not daily nagging.” See article. 

Stockmarkets had an unsettled week amid uncertainty about America and China reaching a trade deal before December 15th, when tariffs are due to rise on a raft of Chinese goods. Donald Trump’s [`ruminations`](    "Your ruminations are your careful thoughts about something. 沉思") about being prepared to wait until after November’s presidential election to reach an agreement spooked investors at first, but was then dismissed as a negotiating tactic. See article.  

Mr Trump said he wanted to raise tariffs on metal imports from Brazil and Argentina, accusing both countries of manipulating their currencies. Finding himself on a roll, the president also threatened to impose 100% tariffs on $2.4bn-worth of French goods, including champagne, after the United States Trade Representative found that France’s digital tax discriminates against American companies such as Amazon, Facebook and Google, and is “inconsistent with prevailing tax principles”. See article. 

The World Trade Organisation rejected the European Union’s claim that it no longer provides illegal state aid to Airbus, a second victory in recent months for Boeing in the pair’s 15-year dispute. In response the USTR said it would look to increase the [`retaliatory`](   "If you take retaliatory action, you try to harm or annoy someone who has harmed or annoyed you. 报复性的; 以牙还牙的") tariffs it imposed in October on a range of European goods following the WTO’s first ruling. 

In contrast with souring trade relations elsewhere, Japan’s Diet approved a trade deal with America that slashes tariffs on American beef and pork imports in return for lower levies on Japanese industrial goods. The limited agreement is a substitute for a Pacific-wide trade pact that Mr Trump withdrew America from. Separately, Japan’s government unveiled a larger-than-expected ¥13trn ($120bn) spending plan to stimulate the economy. 

Brazil’s GDP was 1.2% higher in the third quarter than in the same three months last year. The pace of its economic expansion is quickening following a severe recession in 2015-16. Consumer spending and business investment rose in the quarter, helped by falling interest rates. 

Also pulling out of the doldrums, Turkey’s economy expanded by 0.9% in the third quarter, following nine months of contraction. Growth was spurred by agriculture and industry. Construction, which has been championed by the government, continued to struggle, shrinking by 7.8%. 

UniCredit, Italy’s biggest bank, said it would cut 10% of its workforce, close 500 branches and take other measures to cut costs, as it seeks approval for a €2bn ($2.2bn) share buy-back programme. After years of [`paltry`]( "A paltry amount of money or of something else is one that you consider to be very small. 微小的; 微不足道的") profits, it is rare for a European bank to return cash to investors; UniCredit must convince the European Central Bank that it can do so without weakening its capital buffers.

America exported more crude oil and refined petroleum products in September than it imported, the first time it has been a net exporter of oil for a whole month since records began in the 1940s. Boosted by production from lighter shale oil, America’s net exports averaged 89,000 barrels a day in September, the difference between the 8.7m it imported and the 8.8m it exported. American refineries still rely on heavier foreign crude oil. 

In the wake of LVMH’s offer to take over Tiffany, more consolidation beckoned in the luxury-goods industry as Kering, a French group that includes the Gucci and Saint Laurent brands in its stable, was said to be interested in buying Moncler, an Italian skiwear-maker. 

Mike Pompeo, America’s secretary of state, strongly urged European countries to shut out Huawei from building 5G networks, because of fears over data security. The EU is to discuss the matter at a forthcoming meeting. Huawei responded angrily, describing Mr Pompeo’s allegations as “defamatory and false”. 

The UN announced that Mark Carney will become its envoy on financing climate action when he steps down as governor of the Bank of England next year. The job may present more headaches for Mr Carney than Brexit ever did. This week’s climate-change summit in Madrid declared the past decade to be the hottest on record. New research suggested that emissions may have declined in America and the EU this year, but risen in China, India and the rest of the world.

<h3 id="4.2">Politics this week</h3>

The political leaders of NATO countries gathered in London for a meeting. Donald Trump sparred with both Emmanuel Macron, the president of France, who recently described the military alliance as being in a state of “brain-death”, and with Justin Trudeau, Canada’s prime minister, who was caught on camera mocking the American president. Despite these mini-rows, NATO, at 70 years old, is in better shape than it sometimes looks. See article. 

Germany expelled two Russian diplomats in retaliation for the killing of a Chechen separatist in Berlin in August. The government has been slow to act over the case. 

Finland’s prime minister, Antti Rinne, resigned after a key political ally withdrew support. He had been in office for just six months. 

The prime minister of Malta, Joseph Muscat, said he would stand down, though not until January, as allegations over the murder of an investigative journalist who had been looking into official corruption threatened some of his closest associates. See article. 

With a week to go before an election, Britain’s political parties tried to limit last-minute blunders. Boris Johnson, the Conservative leader, continued to dodge scrutiny from the BBC’s fiercest interviewer, who has already mauled other candidates. The Tories enjoy a ten percentage-point lead, but are worried they may again fail to get a majority. See article. 

Two people were murdered in London by a convicted terrorist at a conference on prison education. He had been released on temporary licence. Questions were raised about the effectiveness of a rehabilitation programme for jihadists, which the killer, who was tackled by the public and shot dead by police, had completed. See article. 

A military court in Suriname convicted the country’s president, Desi Bouterse, of murder and sentenced him to 20 years in prison. In 1982 soldiers killed 15 opponents of the military regime then led by Mr Bouterse. He will not begin his sentence until a decision is made on his appeal. He may be re-elected president next year. See article. 

A court in Honduras sentenced the killers of Berta Cáceres, an environmental activist, to 50 years in prison. She was murdered in 2016 after campaigning to prevent the building of a dam that would have flooded land inhabited by the Lenca people, an [`indigenous`](    "Indigenous people or things belong to the country in which they are found, rather than coming there or being brought there from another country. 本土的; 当地的") group to which she belonged. 

Adel Abdul-Mahdi, the prime minister of Iraq, said he would step down amid large protests over corruption, poor governance and unemployment. His resignation is unlikely to satisfy the demonstrators, who want other changes too. The authorities have killed over 400 people since October, when the unrest began. See article. 

Human-rights groups said up to 450 Iranians were killed during protests over a rise in the state-controlled price of fuel last month. The regime was accused of trying to hide the scale of its crackdown by shutting down the internet. See article. 

Hage Geingob won a second term as president of Namibia in an election overshadowed by claims of corruption against senior members of SWAPO, which has ruled since the country’s independence in 1990. Two former ministers have been arrested on allegations of [`bribery`](    "Bribery is the act of offering someone money or something valuable in order to persuade them to do something for you. 贿赂行为") in connection with the allocation of fishing rights to Iceland’s biggest fishing firm. 

The UN’S World Food Programme said it will double the number of people it is feeding in Zimbabwe to 4.1m, as rising inflation and a collapsing economy push nearly 8m people into hunger. 

The government of Singapore used its new “fake-news” law for the first time, ordering Facebook, among others, to publish a notice next to a post explaining that the authorities deemed it to contain falsehoods. See article. 

Australia’s government repealed a law allowing asylum-seekers held in offshore detention centres to be brought to Australia for medical treatment under exceptional circumstances. It argues that the measure encouraged unauthorised immigrants to try to reach the country by boat. 

During a surprise visit to Afghanistan, Donald Trump said that America would resume peace talks with the Taliban. He also implied that a ceasefire would be part of any deal—an idea the Taliban have long resisted. See article. 

China said it had suspended port calls in Hong Kong by American navy vessels in response to America’s new law in support of democracy in the territory. China also reacted angrily to the passage by America’s House of Representatives of a draft law that would require sanctions to be imposed on Chinese officials for violations of human rights in the far-western region of Xinjiang. 

Riot police clashed with hundreds of people protesting in Wenlou, a town in southern China about 100km from Hong Kong, over the building of a `crematorium`<sup>火葬场</sup>. The police fired tear-gas and reportedly beat and detained dozens of protesters. 

Russia activated a 3,000km natural-gas pipeline to supply the Chinese market. The pipeline cost $55bn and will provide 38bn cubic metres of gas a year to China by 2024. 

The impeachment proceedings against Donald Trump moved to the House Judiciary Committee, after the Intelligence Committee released its report, finding that the president “subverted US foreign policy towards Ukraine…in favour of two politically motivated investigations”. The Judiciary Committee will now consider whether to bring formal charges. See article. 

The Senate confirmed Dan Brouillette as America’s energy secretary. He replaces Rick Perry, one of the “three amigos” who managed Mr Trump’s contacts with Ukraine.  

Kamala Harris withdrew from the Democratic race for president. A year ago Ms Harris was seen as a possible front-runner for the nomination, but she never hit her stride, squeezed between her party’s progressive and moderate wings. Joe Biden said he would consider her as a possible running-mate, should he win. See article. 

Lori Lightfoot, the mayor of Chicago, sacked Eddie Johnson as chief of police. Mr Johnson led America’s second-biggest police force through a tumultuous three years. But Ms Lightfoot said she fired him for lying to her about an incident where he was found asleep at the wheel of his car. Mr Johnson said he didn’t “intentionally mislead or deceive” anyone.

<h3 id="5.1">Alphabet turns a Page and a Brin</h3>

“GOOGLE IS NOT a conventional company,” declared Sergey Brin and Larry Page as they took their firm public in 2004. “We do not intend to become one.” On December 3rd they bowed out as, respectively, president and chief executive of Alphabet, Google’s parent and the world’s fourth-biggest listed firm. Their creation remains unconventional in some ways, if not in others. They leave a mixed legacy for Sundar Pichai, a career Googler in charge of its core search-engine business, who assumes both roles. 

Messrs Brin and Page lived the Silicon Valley dream. Their solution to the problem of indexing the growing world wide web grew out of government-funded research at Stanford University, and was honed in a friend’s garage. Google was founded in 1998. Today it handles over 2trn search queries a year, and produces the Android operating system that powers 80% of the world’s smartphones. It has shaped the age of the internet and mobile computing in the way that Microsoft helped define the age of the desktop PC. Its revenues have grown from $3.2bn in 2004 to $136bn last year. Its market capitalisation has nearly doubled since 2015, to $910bn. 

Its internal culture is famously casual (visitors were often astonished when meetings were interrupted by volleyball games on the central lawn). It has set the tone for a generation of startups, says Karim Lakhani of Harvard Business School. Yet Google was also quick to embrace professional managers. In 2001 it hired Eric Schmidt, a veteran executive, as CEO. Mr Pichai likewise offers what Mr Brin once jokingly referred to as “parental supervision”. 

The firm has grown conventional in other ways, too. Its dominance has attracted the gaze of regulators. Like other powerful firms, it has hired legions of lobbyists to fight its corner, but with only limited success: from Brussels to the Beltway, politicians rail against its power and attitudes to user privacy. The EU has fined it $9bn. Antitrust investigations loom on both sides of the Atlantic. 

Its employees are growing [`restive`](  "If you are restive, you are impatient, bored, or dissatisfied. 不耐烦的; 感到厌烦的; 不满的"); 20,000 walked out a year ago over the firm’s handling of sexual-harassment cases. Those still wedded to Google’s once-official credo, “don’t be evil” (ditched in 2018), have condemned decisions to offer a censored search engine in China (also binned) or work with America’s armed forces. It has sacked staff involved in unionisation efforts. Several said this week that they will file charges with regulators. 

Perhaps the two founders wanted to palm these problems off to someone else. Perhaps they want to focus on the pet projects—from self-driving cars to human-like artificial intelligence and life-extension technology—which Alphabet has cross-subsidised from its ad business. Mr Brin is seldom seen these days; Mr Page did not turn up for Alphabet’s annual shareholder meeting this year. Mr Pichai is seen as a safe pair of hands. However, since Messrs Brin and Page retain control via a dual-class share structure, his freedom will be circumscribed. Small wonder its share price moved little on the news. 

Although Alphabet rakes in billions, it remains a one-trick pony. Ads bring in over 80% of revenue, little changed from 2015. Its share of the online-ad market is down a bit; that of smaller rivals, such as Amazon, is up a lot. Microsoft has successfully reinvented itself as a cloud-computing firm after Bill Gates stepped down in 2000; it is now worth more than Alphabet. Page-Brin bets on futuristic technologies are intellectually thrilling, but have yet to pay off. How long will investors’ patience last?

<h3 id="5.2">ArcelorMittal gets its fingers burned in Italy’s Ilva steel mill</h3>

LAKSHMI MITTAL has grown his company, ArcelorMittal, the world’s biggest steelmaker, through a series of deals across the world. Some, like the mega-merger in 2006 with Arcelor, then Europe’s largest steel producer, were tough. Perhaps none has given Mr Mittal as much grief as the takeover of a massive steel mill in Taranto, in southern Italy. The bureaucratic and legal troubles, combined with a horrible market for steel, last month led Mr Mittal to walk away from the deal he struck with the Italian government a year ago. 

Under that lease-and-purchase agreement ArcelorMittal agreed to buy Ilva, Europe’s biggest single-site steel firm, for €1.8bn ($2bn) and to invest another €2.4bn in cleaning up and modernising a plant dogged by charges of corruption and environmental crime. It agreed to pay €45m a quarter for 18 months to lease the facility, to be deducted from the purchase price. “Mittal saw an opportunity to turn around a very badly managed plant,” says Jason Fairclough of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. The deal would make his company the strongest in south-eastern Europe. 

The timing was poor. Steelmakers everywhere face falling demand from China and a 40% increase in the price of iron ore in the past 18 months. Those in Europe additionally have to contend with reduced appetite for high-quality steel from European carmakers and a 70% rise in the price of EU emissions-trading permits since mid-2018, a big deal for a carbon-belching industry. President Donald Trump’s tariffs have also made Europe the dumping ground for steel from Russia, Turkey and other countries that would otherwise have gone to America. 

Even so, ArcelorMittal expected Ilva to break even this year. Instead, it will lose more than €1bn. The real trouble started this summer. Rumours surfaced that the Italian government might strip Ilva of legal protection from criminal prosecution over environmental liabilities. The government had introduced a legal shield, valid until the end of 2023, when it nationalised Ilva in 2013 after seizing more than €8bn in assets from the Riva family, the previous owners, amid allegations by prosecutors of financial fraud and environmental crimes. (The Rivas deny wrongdoing.) In 2012 Italian authorities ruled that emissions of dust and chemicals from the plant had caused deaths, tumours and respiratory disease. Taranto still occasionally declares a “wind day”, on which schools near the plant close to avoid exposure to dust from open-air mineral deposits. 

On November 3rd Italy’s government indeed revoked Ilva’s legal immunity through new legislation. The next day ArcelorMittal sent three state-appointed administrators a withdrawal notice stating its contractual right to walk away from the agreement if a new law were to “materially impair” its ability to operate the plant or implement its turnaround plan. “The legal protection was a prerequisite for the deal,” says Paul Weigh, a spokesman for ArcelorMittal. The company is also `incensed`<sup>激怒</sup> by the government’s demand that it turn off one of three blast furnaces in Taranto in December, which will considerably reduce its output. 

The revocation was engineered by the Five-Star Movement (M5S), an anti-establishment party with strong roots in the south that governs in coalition with the centre-left. Its members had long campaigned for the closure of the plant while in opposition. Having initially backed the legal shield, they then supported ditching it. 

Giuseppe Conte, the centre-left prime minister, wants Ilva to survive. It employs 10,700 people directly, and indirectly as many as 60,000—most of them in Puglia, a poor region in Italy’s heel. The government is in talks with the Mittals to rescue the deal before a court hearing on December 20th. Mr Mittal and Mr Conte may yet come to an agreement to restore the legal shield. 

If the talks fail and the case goes to court the government will [`prop up`](   "To prop up something means to support it or help it to survive. 支撑; 维持") Ilva with emergency loans to protect jobs. The government’s shabby treatment of someone willing to pour billions into one of its poorest regions is unlikely to encourage other bids. In the meantime, Italy’s battered reputation with foreign investors has suffered another dent.

<h3 id="5.3">Let them eat Christmas cake</h3>

EVERYONE FEELS like winding down in December. Even if you do not celebrate Christmas, the New Year is approaching and most people take a few days’ break. In many workplaces this feeling of “mission accomplished” is accompanied by an established tradition: the office party. 

In boom times these can be truly lavish affairs. Robbie Williams sang at Deutsche Bank’s global-equities party in 2001. A Bloomberg event in 2000, based on the seven deadly sins, was said to have cost £1m (then $1.5m). At the “Googlympus” in 2006, the internet group had tents named after different Greek gods while staff amused themselves at the “wine cork shooting gallery”. 

Few companies today desire the publicity that tends to follow such events. The natural question is, if you are spending that amount on a party, how much are you charging clients? Companies are rightly more sensitive than they were about the risks involved when workers lose their inhibitions after consuming too much alcohol. A survey of American companies by the suitably named Challenger Gray & Christmas, an outplacement firm, found that 59% had discussed, or planned to discuss, the dangers of “inappropriate celebrating” with staff. 

To avoid these dangers, the chief operating officer of BDO, an accountancy firm, has suggested that two chaperones attend seasonal celebrations, along with first-aiders. Other accounting firms have suggested holding daytime events rather than after-hours drinks parties. 

There is a lot to be said for daytime celebrations. First, it makes attendance easier for anyone caring for small children, or elderly relatives, and who thus finds it difficult to stay out late. Second, people are likely to be a bit more restrained in their alcohol consumption at lunchtime than in the evenings. And third, celebrating during working hours feels like a genuine break from duties; attending after work seems more like an obligation. 

Most workers don’t expect their seasonal event to turn into a Bacchanal; they are just hoping to avoid [`tedium`](  "If you talk about the tedium of a job, task, or situation, you think it is boring and frustrating. 枯燥无聊"). A survey of British office workers in 2014 found that only a quarter looked forward to their Christmas event and 71% would rather have a small cash bonus than a `knees-up`<sup>气氛活跃的庆祝活动</sup>. 

In Bartleby’s experience, office parties come in three types. The first is the sit-down lunch, in which you are inevitably seated next to someone whose name you do not know, even though you have spent five years politely nodding at them when you pass in the corridor. Two hours of social awkwardness ensue. The second type of do is the evening event with excruciatingly loud music. On the plus side, no one can hear you speak so it does not matter if you have forgotten their names; on the down side, after half an hour everyone over 30 is so deafened that they wish they were at home with a nice book or a box set of “The West Wing”. 

The third sort of event is the stand-up do with drinks and nibbles, when the food is never enough to absorb the alcohol and you are permanently caught in a state of [`angst`]( "Angst is a feeling of anxiety and worry. 焦虑") over whether you are boring the person you are talking to more than they are boring you. 

Naturally, there is an economic answer and it is specialisation. Think of Adam Smith’s pin factory where everyone plays their different part; let everyone have the party they want. Some may want to down the prosecco but others may be happier only to gorge on cake. 

Seasonal events at The Economist are highly segregated. The leader writers sit quietly in a corner, sipping sherry and discussing structural reform; the Keynesians borrow money off the rest of the staff to pay for their drinks; believers in central-bank independence down pints of beer in feats of “quantitative drinking”; neoclassical economists sip water, arguing that no rational person would consume alcohol, given the risks of hangovers and liver damage; while those who favour modern monetary theory guzzle vodka shots on the ground that it is impossible to get drunk if you control your own alcohol supply. 

In short, it is easier to enjoy yourself if you can do so in your own fashion. And that may include not partying at all. If managers think staff would rather spend time at home than attend, let them; the company will save money. Last, but not least, if managers must make a speech, keep it short. Something along the lines of “You’ve all done very well this year, good luck next.” Save the Churchillian [`rhetoric`](    "If you refer to speech or writing as rhetoric, you disapprove of it because it is intended to convince and impress people but may not be sincere or honest. 虚华词藻") for the annual general meeting.

<h3 id="5.4">Nationalising BT may not improve Britain’s broadband</h3>

THIS AUGUST Andrew Cohen, boss of Bellamy’s Organic, an Australian maker of infant formula, enthused to investors about having a brand “that’s loved in China”. So loved, in fact, that a few weeks later Mengniu Dairy, China’s second-biggest producer of milk products, said it wanted to buy Bellamy’s for A$1.5bn ($1bn). On December 5th its shareholders voted in favour of the deal. 

At first Bellamy’s seemed to be milking it, not Mengniu. An Australian government committee that reviews foreign acquisitions set out conditions: Mengniu must keep headquarters and most of the board Australian, and pour A$12m into local factories. Mengniu offered a 59% premium on the firm’s share price, which had shed three-fifths in the 18 months before the offer (it has rebounded a bit since). Mr Cohen blamed falling Chinese birth rates, a regulatory hold-up on imports and competition in China’s thirsty infant-formula market. 

Now Mengniu looks like the cat that got the cream. It wasted no time in making another bid on November 25th to buy Lion Dairy & Drinks, Australia’s second-largest milk processor, for A$600m. The pair of acquisitions would hand it a rich vat of organic and premium brands that China’s middle class covets, including Farmers Union yogurt and licences to the Yoplait franchise. Mengniu can tap high-quality Aussie milk. And it is one in the eye for Yili, its bigger cross-town dairy rival in Hohhot, the regional capital of Inner Mongolia. 

The two firms control about half of China’s dairy market. If it wins Lion, Mengniu stands a chance at surpassing Yili by revenue next year, reckons Song Liang, an independent dairy analyst (both want to make sales of 100bn yuan, or $14bn). They are expanding in South-East Asia, where Bellamy’s and Lion are already popular. Last year Yili acquired Thailand’s biggest ice-cream maker. In August it bought Westland Milk Products, a New Zealand co-operative. It envisions “a vast dairy bridge crossing the Pacific Ocean”. 

In a decade Chinese milk production will meet only half of domestic demand, says Terrance Liu of CLSA, a broker, down from around 70% today. And, as Mengniu and its rival move overseas and upmarket, they need better ways to keep products chilled through production and transport, which rich-world firms can teach them. At home spending on formula per infant is rising thanks to declining rates of breast-feeding in many cities. A deadly tainted-milk scandal in 2008 has put shoppers off local products. CLSA estimates that four-fifths of Bellamy’s products have ended up in China thanks to a flourishing informal trade by so-called daigou, who buy products overseas and resell them online. 

New regulations have recently crimped grey-market sales. But Mengniu is expected to work out the import-clearance delay `promptly`<sup>迅速地</sup>: COFCO Dairy, a state-owned giant, owns 24% of the Hong Kong-listed firm. China’s $62bn dairy market is still little more than a tenth of the world’s by value. But Euromonitor, a research firm, predicts that by 2022 it will overtake America as the globe’s biggest market for dairy. Welcome to the land of milk and money.

<h3 id="5.5">Saudi Aramco’s IPO is the biggest ever</h3>

Editor’s note: On December 5th, soon after this article was published, Saudi Aramco said its IPO had raised $25.6bn, valuing the company at $1.7trn 

THE ASPIRATION was clear. First, list a portion of Saudi Aramco, a state-owned oil giant that is the world’s most profitable company. Then use the [`windfall`](    "A windfall is a sum of money that you receive unexpectedly or by luck, for example, if you win a lottery. 意外之财") to diversify Saudi Arabia’s economy. Muhammad bin Salman, its crown prince, expected investors to swoon over the company’s rich reserves, low costs and $111bn in annual net income. “If you want to invest in Exxon, Chevron, BP,” one banker involved in the listing told The Economist in October, “why don’t you just go and buy Aramco?” It turns out that many investors would rather not. 

As we went to press, Aramco was expected to announce its offer price, with trading to begin soon after. The result is likely to be the biggest initial public offering (IPO) in history. It will also prove to be a disappointment. 

Prince Muhammad’s initial desire—a 5% listing at a valuation of $2trn—would have raised a [`staggering`](   "Something that is staggering is very surprising. 令人震惊的") $100bn, four times what Alibaba, the current record-holder, drummed up in 2014. Aramco’s valuation range of $1.7trn or so is lower than the princely target but still too high for many institutional investors. This weak appetite led the company to decide to float just 1.5% of its shares on Saudi Arabia’s exchange. It will probably edge past Alibaba’s $25bn. 

The reasons for listing Aramco have not changed. Saudi Arabia needs to move beyond oil, which accounts for nearly 70% of government revenues. That would be a dangerous dependence in any era, let alone one with swelling youth unemployment and doubts about long-term demand for fossil fuels in a world worried about climate change. 

If the rationale was straightforward, execution was not. Prince Muhammad first suggested an IPO in an interview with this newspaper in 2016. The years since have been filled with delays and controversy. Concerns about legal liabilities undermined plans for a listing in London, New York or on another global bourse. The murder of Jamal Khashoggi, a dissident journalist, at the Saudi consulate in Turkey last year cast a pall over Prince Muhammad’s sweeping modernisation plan. 

Aramco’s successful issuance of $12bn in bonds in April helped build confidence in the flotation. Recent months have seen a frenzy of activity to ensure its success. The kingdom hired more than two dozen big banks to shepherd it through, and appointed a new chairman for the company and a new oil minister. 

The listing was nevertheless marred by several problems. Some were (mostly) beyond Prince Muhammad’s control. Investors’ concerns about the global economy and weak demand pushed the oil price below $60 a barrel in August. President Donald Trump’s warnings of a protracted trade war with China could weaken it further. Missile and drone strikes (believed to have originated in Iran, which backs Saudi enemies in neighbouring Yemen) knocked out more than half Aramco’s oil production in September, highlighting the company’s security risks. 

He has had more sway over Aramco’s offer price and size of the float. Many investors balked at Aramco’s valuation range, which was announced in November. Bernstein, one of the few research outfits not linked to a bank collecting Aramco’s fees, reckoned $1.2trn-1.5trn was more reasonable—a range confirmed by a survey of institutional investors, who told Bernstein they would buy Aramco at a mean valuation of $1.26trn. 

Prince Muhammad’s desire for a higher offer price was understandable. On many metrics, Aramco easily outcompetes rivals such as ExxonMobil or BP. Its reserves are 15 times larger, production costs a quarter as big, debt negligible and return on capital superb. Chances are that when the world takes its last sip of oil, it will be Saudi crude. 


But oil investors in 2019, skittish about the commodity’s prospects, care more about cash. At a valuation of $1.7trn, Aramco’s dividend yield would be lower than the supermajors’ (see chart). Investors surveyed by Bernstein worried about Aramco’s governance. Saudi Arabia may lean on the company if national finances deteriorate—the IMF expects Saudi debt to be 23% of GDP this year, up from 17% in 2017. As important, Aramco’s sales growth is limited by Saudi Arabia’s habit of limiting output to stabilise global oil markets. 

Facing a chasm between the prince’s preferred, high price and what international investors were willing to pay, Aramco abruptly cancelled road shows in America and Europe. It is expected to secure investments from neighbours, including Abu Dhabi and Kuwait. 

But many buyers will be locals. The company and its bankers courted Saudis eagerly, through call centres and advertisements on billboards, social media, even ATMs. The Saudi central bank doubled leverage limits for retail investors buying shares in Aramco. Wealthy families in the capital, Riyadh, feel that participation in the IPO is required to maintain good standing, one local businessman explains. 

Of course, $25bn wouldn’t be nothing. Still, bankers will get a fraction of the fees they hoped for. Aramco may raise less cash than it would have at a lower price: floating the full 5% at a valuation of $1.2trn could rake in $60bn. Saudi Arabia will see capital flow mostly within the kingdom, not gush in from the outside. A reliance on local shareholders poses a political problem, if a falling oil price depresses Aramco’s share price. Prince Muhammad is keenly aware that neighbouring countries have looked fragile of late—leaders have been ousted in Algeria, Lebanon and, most recently, Iraq. 

Propping up the oil price looks as tricky as ever. Last year OPEC, an oil-producers’ club, and its allies, led by Russia, agreed to lower output by 1.2m barrels a day, or 2.3% of their production. The deal was extended to March 2020. But the cartel may need to seek deeper cuts, as supply surges in Brazil, Guyana and Norway. 

Merely encouraging OPEC members to comply with the existing deal, let alone commit to more cuts, will be tough. The group’s meeting in Vienna on December 5th-6th promises to be tense. Russia has pumped oil faster this year than before the deal. With partners overproducing Saudi Arabia has consistently had to undershoot its quota. The new oil minister wants more compliance from the others, says Helima Croft of RBC Capital Markets, an investment bank. The question is how forcefully he will seek it. Either way, the listing will leave the kingdom no less dependent on the price of crude than it is today.

<h3 id="5.6">SMB Winning pays $14bn for rights to Guinea’s iron mountain</h3>

WHEN PROSPECTORS discovered a [`gargantuan`](   "If you say that something is gargantuan, you are emphasizing that it is very large. 巨大的") deposit of iron ore in the misty Simandou mountains 17 years ago, many Guineans hoped it would transform their impoverished country. The remote location makes its estimated 2.4bn tonnes of iron ore—valued at perhaps $230bn—hard to mine. Gyrating commodity prices scared off investment. So did lurid corruption scandals involving billionaires, government officials and mining companies. 

A new chapter has opened in the saga. An embattled Israeli diamond tycoon, Beny Steinmetz, surrendered his claims to Simandou in February, after ten years of legal battles with Guinea’s government and Rio Tinto, an Anglo-Australian mining giant. Simandou North was put up for tender. Last month the winner was announced: SMB, a joint-venture owned by a consortium which includes Winning Shipping, a Singaporean maritime firm, UMS, a Guinean-French logistics company, and Shandong Weiqiao, a big Chinese aluminium producer. The entity, in which Guinea’s government holds a 10% stake, will pay $15bn to develop the site, build a new deepwater port and a 650km railway to link the two. Guinea’s parliament is expected to wave the deal through in the coming weeks. 

The successful bid is a coup for SMB, which is barely known outside the west African nation. It is also a departure from SMB’s previous business—bauxite. The firm was founded in 2014 to meet China’s voracious demand for the ore, from which aluminium is smelted. Guinea has a quarter of the world’s proven reserves of the stuff. In 2018 SMB exported 36m tonnes of it, worth around $2.1bn, mostly to China, which imports about half its bauxite from SMB. Winning’s vessels ferry about 200 shiploads a year to Chinese ports. 

The private joint-venture keeps its finances close to its chest but Bob Adam, an expert on mining in Guinea, reckons that after taxes, royalties and operating costs SMB is making about $800m profit a year. “They are now the most significant economic enterprise in Guinea,” he says—and the only one among the world’s biggest bauxite producers with a direct link to China. 

A shift into iron ore presents challenges. Building a port and a railway through the country’s malaria-infested forest will take years and could cost much more than the estimated $10bn. SMB will have to co-ordinate with Rio Tinto and Chalco, a Hong Kong-listed company controlled by Chinalco, a Chinese state-run firm, which jointly control Simandou’s southern blocks. The Boké region (the B in the firm’s name) has been plagued by riots. Many local residents are angered by lack of access to clean water or health care. But China is keen on Simandou’s high-grade iron ore, which emits less pollution when processed, says Eric Humphery-Smith from Verisk Maplecroft, a risk consultancy. It also wants to lock in supply. And it can afford to wait.

<h3 id="5.7">The agonising dilemma of Spanish firms in Latin America</h3>

THIS IS A year of poignant anniversaries in Spain’s relationship with Latin America. Exactly 500 years ago Hernán Cortés launched his conquest of Mexico. In 1939 Mexico’s left-wing president, Lázaro Cárdenas, opened the door to Spaniards fleeing fascism at the end of the civil war. It might have been a celebratory year for Spanish business, too. In 1989 Telefónica, Spain’s biggest telecoms firm, made its first incursion into Latin America by bidding for a Chilean counterpart, unleashing a flood of Spanish investment into the region in the 1990s known as la reconquista. Instead, it has been a year of pot-banging protests and economic [`turmoil`](   "Turmoil is a state of confusion, disorder, uncertainty, or great anxiety. 混乱; 骚乱") in the region. It says a lot that 30 years after it planted the flag, Telefónica has decided to cut its losses in the former Spanish colonies, and may sell its businesses there altogether. 

Telefónica’s new strategy, announced late last month, is part of a rethink of the company by its boss, José María Álvarez-Pallete. Its market value has almost halved over the past five years to €35bn ($39bn). It carries a whopping €38bn of net debt. And, common to all global telecoms firms, it faces the challenge of offering customers much faster wireless speeds via 5G and more digital services. As a result it plans to refocus on four core markets, Spain, Brazil, Germany and Britain, and create separate digital and infrastructure businesses. On December 4th Orange, its French rival, announced similar plans to reinvent itself for the digital age. 

Yet it is the prospect that Telefónica may sell its businesses in Argentina, Colombia, Mexico, Chile, Peru and other so-called Hispano-American countries, that is most significant. They account for 21% of its revenues. Their sale, which could raise €13bn or more, represents a historic U-turn that is likely to reverberate in Spain’s boardrooms. Like Telefónica, Spanish banks, energy firms and other companies have reason to agonise over the slow growth and currency volatility across the Atlantic. Their industries, too, are in the throes of technological disruption. For some Latin America is no longer a land of opportunity, but a distraction. 

For years Spaniards celebrated the revival of their imperial ties to the New World. When Latin American countries started to liberalise their economies in the late 1980s, Spain was a country with a meagre population, inward-looking companies, and a pressing need to globalise. Few Europeans believed that it would fulfil its aim of becoming a bridge to Latin America. However, as Lourdes Casanova of Cornell University recalls, its companies needed quickly to build scale there to resist other European firms breathing down their necks at home. Latin America helped turn Spanish firms into global ones. 

Within a few decades Spain had become the second-biggest foreign investor in the region after America. Its firms have investments today worth €156bn there. The biggest, such as Telefónica, Santander and BBVA in banking, Iberdrola in utilities, and Repsol in oil and gas, accounted for most of Spain’s investment in the region. Their shared language, as well as passable Portuñol in Brazil, enabled them to operate service industries in places where telecommunications, banking and utilities were hopelessly backward. Profits from Latin America during a commodities boom helped Spanish firms through the financial crisis of 2008-09. 

That is only half of the story, though. After underbidding in 1990 for Telmex, the Mexican telecoms monopoly that turned Carlos Slim into one of the world’s richest men, Telefónica went on to overpay elsewhere, sinking over €140bn in the region, a fortune compared with what the assets are worth now. The ride since then has been a rollercoaster. From the tequila crisis in Mexico in 1994-95, through mega-devaluations and political upheaval in Brazil and Argentina, to left-wing dictatorship in Venezuela, Spanish investors have had a crash course in disaster management. Repsol may have suffered the worst. In 2012 Peronists in Argentina—who beat a reformist incumbent in October’s presidential election—expropriated Repsol’s stake in YPF, the national oil company. It was only partially compensated for the almost $16bn it had paid for the holding in 1999. More recently it has had such trouble sourcing heavy crude from Venezuela and Mexico, it is reportedly considering carrying it from western Canada to its European refineries. 

Yet even without crisis, day-to-day business has been a struggle. BBVA and Santander have used their big Latin America subsidiaries to help offset zero interest rates closer to home, and have no plans to pull out. Now Mexico, where BBVA is the biggest bank, is flirting with recession. Santander has done well recently in Brazil, where it is the largest foreign bank. But it suffers from currency weakness in many parts of Latin America. Telefónica’s revenues, returns and cash flows in Peru, Chile and Colombia have flagged owing to competition from scrappy new entrants putting market share ahead of profitability. 

Spain is not yet in full `retreat`<sup>撤退</sup>. Telefónica’s moves could be a combination of selling assets, as it is doing in Central America, and forming alliances, as it has recently done in Mexico by agreeing to use part of AT&T’s network as a way to reduce losses. But it may sell up altogether to reduce debt quickly. Firms such as Liberty Latin America and Millicom are expanding fast around the region, largely through acquisitions. China Mobile is showing interest in Latin America as well. Telefónica’s decision to stay put in Brazil, by far its biggest market, suggests that its new mantra is focus. 

Other Spanish firms have made similar calculations: BBVA by concentrating mainly on Mexico, and Santander on Brazil. As pressure increases on banks to adapt to the fintech era, and on energy firms like Repsol and Iberdrola to reduce carbon emissions, focus makes more sense than empire-building. Even Cortés was forced to make a tactical retreat in 1520 in what is called “La Noche Triste”. For Telefónica, this is undoubtedly a “sad night”. But if its retreat is more than tactical, other firms may sound one, too.

<h3 id="6.1">Obituary: Jonathan Miller died on November 27th</h3>

WHENEVER HE ERUPTED onto a set or into a studio, Jonathan Miller made an instant impression. Part came from his height and `gawkiness`<sup>腼腆</sup>, the tweed jacket, the excessively angular elbows and knees (since the body was not only possesssed by him but also possessed him, making up a large part of what he actually was, including his notions of effort and success). But he also drew attention because, as often as not, he had a book of neuroscience in his hand. 

The point he was making was this. Science was hard, and needed constant application. But the sort of thing he spent five decades doing, putting on plays, making television documentaries, directing more than 50 operas, he could achieve with his left hand behind his back. Art was easy, ridiculously so. Most television was utter banality; most opera forgettable, vulgar and sentimental. So it took very little originality to make them memorable. He liked to invoke the psychologists’ duck-rabbit sketch, in which the seeing of the duck precluded the alternative seeing of the rabbit, and vice versa; to bring to the fore “aspects” of a work, as Wittgenstein said, that had previously been invisible, so that audiences would perceive it in a completely different way. 

For the BBC in 1966, for example, he turned “Alice in Wonderland”, which had been horribly Disneyfied, into a Victorian child’s dream of a hot Oxford summer in which all the characters were prating or dozing dons. That was what the story was about: Oxford, childhood. (People who said it was Freudian clearly knew nothing about Freud.) In 1982 he set Verdi’s “Rigoletto” in Little Italy in New York, with mobsters swaggering and “La Donna è Mobile” kicked out of a jukebox, because Verdi’s duke was clearly a hoodlum too, and the atmosphere that of “The Godfather”. His “Così fan Tutte” in 1995 had costumes by Armani, huge mirrors and mobile phones, a comment on the narcissism of the modern age. His “St Matthew Passion” took the performers out of their tuxedos and inert choirs and put them in a circle, in their own clothes, acting out the drama; his film of “The Symposium”, called “The Drinking Party”, put the actors into dinner jackets as old boys at a school reunion, reading Plato’s discourse on love in one of the temples at Stowe. 

All those were great successes, cementing his reputation as the most brilliant mind on the British cultural scene, and yet even then he agonised over why he was doing this. He had meant to be a doctor, specifically a neurologist. Instead, probably out of weak-mindedness, he always said “yes” whenever anyone turned up at his door and asked if he would like to play. (It was almost involuntary, like blushing or sneezing, and he could never identify the point at which the conscious exercise of intention occurred.) The first of these accidents happened when he was lured away from his medical training by three Cambridge friends, Alan Bennett, Peter Cook and Dudley Moore, to write and perform in “Beyond the Fringe” in 1960, a revue which pilloried everything the English held dear, from the Battle of Britain to tea to Shakespeare. After this had electrified both London and New York, it was hard to go back to hospital work. But he would have done, had he not been invited to direct a play at the Royal Court…then to direct opera for Sadler’s Wells…then to the National Theatre…and so it went. He fell into work as he fell into long-lasting love, accidentally. 

Yet he should have stayed intentionally with medicine. First, because what he was doing was ephemeral, even when his “Rigoletto” and his “Mikado”(translated to the Marx Brothers’ Fredonia, and with the Japanese stripped out) were both in the repertoire for decades. By contrast, originality in medicine could bring lasting benefit. And second, because in science one was either right or wrong, and one’s work was peer-reviewed by people who at least knew the topic. Instead he had to put up with critics, snivelling pipsqueaks who knew 100% less than he did about the piece in question but whined that he was messing it around. When they called him a polymath, a term he loathed, they really meant he was a jack of all trades and master of none. What idiot invertebrates they all were, like the sea slugs he had collected as a boy and then had the greatest pleasure dissecting and slicing for his microscope. God (though it had never occurred to him that there might be a God) could rot the lot of them. 

As some consolation, he could bring his medical expertise to bear on art. For the BBC he produced a television series, “The Body in Question”, in which among a firework display of observations he compared red blood cells clotting to Duchamp’s “Nude descending a staircase” and the movement of cilia on cells to Van Gogh’s “Wheatfield with Lark”. His radio series on madness featured the voices of both experts and those being treated. In opera, too, he applied the knowledge gained from listening to, and watching, patients. In “La Traviata” he asked Violetta to twist her hair as she sang, another almost involuntary gesture, and strictly made her stay in bed for her death aria. It was a full-time business, dying. 

England he found difficult, with its [`snobberies`](    "Snobbery is the attitude of a snob. 自命不凡") and [`condescensions`]( "Condescension is condescending behaviour. 纡尊降贵"). His knighthood (though of course he said yes to it, weakly, as ever) made him shrivel up. He could have lived in New York, where he briefly worked for the New Yorker and where, for the first time, he felt Jewish. But he stayed put, moving all of a mile from Park Crescent NW1, where he was born, to Gloucester Crescent NW1, with Alan Bennett over the road. He lived among countless books, the notebooks in which he recorded his curiosity about everything, and his photographs of bits of buildings and superimposed layers of posters on walls, the discrete instalments from which his perception of the world incrementally emerged. 

Did all this add up to a triumphant life? Many would have thought so. In moments of relaxation and satisfaction he would rock his long frame back and clasp his hands behind his head. But Wittgenstein’s nagging question remained: exactly what made the difference between “I lift my arms,” and “My arms go up”?

<h3 id="７.1">Our books of the year</h3>

Dignity: Seeking Respect in Back Row America. By Chris Arnade. Sentinel; 304 pages; $30 and £25 

Over several years the author of this book, a former Wall Street trader, conducted thoughtful interviews in neglected communities across America, and took moving photographs of his subjects. The result is a quietly [`revelatory`](  "A revelatory account or statement tells you a lot that you did not know. 揭示的; 启示性的") portrait of what he calls the country’s “back row”. 

An American Summer: Love and Death in Chicago. By Alex Kotlowitz. Nan A. Talese; 304 pages; $27.95 

Chicago has suffered 14,000 murders in the past two decades; overwhelmingly the victims are African-American or Hispanic. This is an intimate and sympathetic depiction of several people involved in, and affected by, deadly crime. The killings seem senseless, but, says the author, the city can do more to grasp their causes. 

Winners Take All: The Elite Charade of Changing the World. By Anand Giridharadas. Knopf; 304 pages; $26.95. Allen Lane; £12.99 

A timely polemic against philanthrocapitalism, which argues that supposedly do-gooding companies merely offer sticking-plaster solutions to social problems that they have helped create. Such efforts, the author says, do little to make up for a winner-takes-all philosophy that is holding down wages and transferring the burden of risk onto employees. 

No Visible Bruises. By Rachel Louise Snyder. Bloomsbury; 320 pages; $28 

It is the dark matter of violent crime: unseen but everywhere. This investigation into domestic violence in America blends [`harrowing`](   "A harrowing experience is extremely upsetting or disturbing. 折磨人的") testimony with persuasive recommendations on how to help victims and perpetrators. A book that manages to be both personal and panoramic, angry and hopeful. 

Assad or We Burn the Country. By Sam Dagher. Little, Brown; 592 pages; $29 and £25 

Although the horrors of Syria’s civil war are well documented, this chronicle by a Wall Street Journal correspondent still offers new insights into a struggle that has reshaped the Middle East. Many are based on his rare access to Manaf Tlass, a one-time confidant of Bashar al-Assad, who charts the accidental president’s metamorphosis into a blood-soaked dictator. 

The Light that Failed. By Stephen Holmes and Ivan Krastev. Pegasus Books; 256 pages; $26.95. Allen Lane; £20 

When the Soviet Union collapsed and communism fell, the countries of eastern Europe set out to emulate Western democracies. But, as the authors of this perceptive book eloquently relate, their attitude to liberal democracy soured amid globalisation and the financial crisis—forces that also fed the rise of nationalism in the West. Russia, meanwhile, replaced Soviet rule with a revanchist autocracy. 

Presidential Misconduct: From George Washington to Today. Edited by James Banner junior. New Press; 512 pages; $29.99 

In 1974 the special counsel to the impeachment inquiry commissioned a survey of presidential misconduct from Washington to Lyndon Johnson. Brought up-to-date with chapters on presidents from Richard Nixon to Barack Obama, this useful study supplies the scales on which more recent wrongdoing can be weighed. 

Say Nothing. By Patrick Radden Keefe. Doubleday; 464 pages; $28.95. William Collins; £20 

Framed as an inquiry into the death of Jean McConville, a mother of ten who was abducted and murdered by the IRA in 1972, this is a masterful exploration of the motives of terrorists, the stories they tell themselves and how they make the transition to peace—or, in some cases, fail to. 

Remembering Emmett Till. By Dave Tell. University of Chicago Press; 312 pages; $25 and £19 

A fine history of racism, poverty and memory in the Mississippi Delta told through the lynching of Emmett Till, a black 14-year-old from Chicago whose murder in 1955—and his mother’s determination to display his mutilated features in an open coffin—made him an early martyr of the civil-rights movement. 

Amritsar 1919: An Empire of Fear and the Making of a Massacre. By Kim Wagner. Yale University Press; 360 pages; $32.50 and £20 

At least 379 people were killed by British soldiers in the Amritsar massacre on April 13th 1919, making that one of the darkest days in the history of the empire. On the event’s centenary, this book persuasively argues that it was less of an aberration than apologists for empire, including Winston Churchill, have chosen to believe. 

Maoism: A Global History. By Julia Lovell. Knopf; 610 pages; $37.50. Bodley Head; £30 

Mao Zedong was a despot who caused tens of millions of deaths; yet his name does not attract the same opprobrium as Hitler’s or Stalin’s. Indeed, his legend and ideas have inspired revolutionaries around the world. As the author of this book shows, his manipulated image retains a powerful allure in China and beyond. “Like a dormant virus”, she writes, “Maoism has demonstrated a tenacious, global talent for latency.” 

The Regency Years. By Robert Morrison. W.W. Norton; 416 pages; $29.95. Published in Britain as “The Regency Revolution”; Atlantic Books; £20 

“I awoke one morning and found myself famous,” Lord Byron, a Regency poet, once said. The period itself has suffered from the opposite problem—eclipsed by the more solemn and substantial Georgian and Victorian ones that preceded and followed it. Arguing that Britain truly started to become modern in the Regency era, this delightful book explains why it deserves to be better known. 

How to be a Dictator. By Frank Dikötter. Bloomsbury; 304 pages; $28 and £25 

What do Mussolini, Hitler, Stalin, Mao, Kim Il Sung, Nicolae Ceausescu, Papa Doc Duvalier and Mengistu Haile Mariam have in common? This insightful handbook for gangsters is written by a distinguished historian of 20th-century China. 

An Impeccable Spy: Richard Sorge, Stalin’s Master Agent. By Owen Matthews. Bloomsbury; 448 pages; $30 and £25 

Richard Sorge’s bravery and recklessness in the Soviet cause in Tokyo—where boozing and seduction were among his main espionage techniques—were matched by the venality and cowardice of his masters in Moscow. Despite their brutal incompetence, his intelligence helped turn the course of the second world war. A tragic, heroic story, magnificently told with an understated rage. 

The Education of an Idealist. By Samantha Power. Dey Street Books; 592 pages; $29.99. William Collins; £20 

An engaging insider’s account of foreign-policymaking in what now seems like a different era of diplomacy. It describes the efforts of its author—Barack Obama’s Irish-born ambassador to the United Nations—to juggle idealism with the realities of governing, while also juggling motherhood with the demands of representing America on the world stage. 

Family Papers: A Sephardic Journey Through the Twentieth Century. By Sarah Abrevaya Stein. Farrar, Straus and Giroux; 336 pages; $28 

This history of the Levy family of Salonika follows its subjects through interwar Greece to the present day. It is a painstaking feat of reconstruction that draws on correspondence in Ottoman Turkish, Hebrew, French and especially Ladino, the language of Sephardic Jewry. Much of the clan was murdered in Auschwitz in 1943; those who survive are now spread across the globe. And yet, the author says, they retain a family resemblance. 

The Last Stone. By Mark Bowden. Atlantic Monthly Press; 304 pages; $27. Grove Press; £16.99 

True-crime writers in America face a high bar, set by illustrious predecessors such as Truman Capote. The author of “Black Hawk Down” rises to the challenge in this reconstruction of how a horrific crime—the disappearance of two sisters from a mall in Maryland in 1975—was partially solved 40 years later. Dogged and ingenious interrogation of a mendacious suspect finally gets at the truth. 

Good Economics for Hard Times. By Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo. PublicAffairs; 432 pages; $30. Allen Lane; £25 

The real meaning of this book by a Nobel-prizewinning duo of economists lies in its method—a patient attempt to take on tough problems through empirical evidence. Known for pioneering the use of randomised controlled trials, the pair offer insights into thorny global issues ranging from inequality to corruption, all with refreshing humility. 

Open Borders. By Bryan Caplan. Illustrated by Zach Weinersmith. First Second; 256 pages; $19.99. St. Martin’s Press; £15.99 

An enlightened polemic in cartoon format, this book—by a team comprising an economics professor and an illustrator—persuasively rebuffs the arguments against migration commonly made by politicians. At the same time it shows how an accessible and respectful case can be made on a neuralgic subject. 

Narrative Economics. By Robert Shiller. Princeton University Press; 400 pages; $27.95 and £20 

The author, another Nobel laureate, explores how the public’s subjective perceptions can shape economic trends. The result is a sensible and welcome escape from the dead hand of mathematical models of economics. 

Schism. By Paul Blustein. CIGI Press; 400 pages; $27.95. McGill-Queen’s University Press; £27.99 

A fascinating, detailed account of the history of tensions in America’s trade relationship with China. It explains the back story to today’s conflict—and reveals how difficult it will be to escape it. 

Capitalism, Alone. By Branko Milanovic. Belknap Press; 304 pages; $29.95 and £23.95 

A scholar of inequality warns that while capitalism may have seen off rival economic systems, the survival of liberal democracies is anything but assured. The [`amoral`](  "If you describe someone as amoral, you do not like the way they behave because they do not seem to care whether what they do is right or wrong. 不辨是非的") pursuit of profit in more liberal capitalist societies has eroded the ethical norms that help sustain openness and democracy, he argues; now that tendency threatens to push such places in the direction of more authoritarian capitalist societies, such as China. 

Furious Hours: Murder, Fraud and the Last Trial of Harper Lee. By Casey Cep. Knopf; 336 pages; $26.95. William Heinemann; £20 

An ingeniously structured, beautifully written double mystery—one concerning the Reverend Willie Maxwell, who was accused of murdering five relatives for the insurance money in Alabama in the 1970s (before being fatally shot himself); the other, Harper Lee’s abortive efforts to write a book about the case. Tom Radney, a lawyer who is the story’s third main character, defended Maxwell—and his killer. 

Kafka’s Last Trial: The Case of a Literary Legacy. By Benjamin Balint. W.W. Norton; 288 pages; $26.95. Picador; £14.99 

An account of the struggle over Kafka’s papers between competing archives in Israel and Germany—plus a woman who inherited them from a friend of his editor, Max Brod—which played out after most of the writer’s family had died in the Holocaust. A book about the provenance of art, and how much, in the end, it matters. 

Underland: A Deep Time Journey. By Robert Macfarlane. W.W. Norton; 384 pages; $27.95. Hamish Hamilton; £20 

A haunting examination of the world below the surface—a place that has always been envisioned as a zone of treasure and of dread. From the Paris catacombs to the soil of Epping Forest to caverns in remotest Norway, the author, a celebrated nature-writer, re-envisions the planet from the ground down. 

Three Women. By Lisa Taddeo. Simon & Schuster; 320 pages; $27. Bloomsbury Circus; £16.99 

Eight years of reporting went into this portrait of American sexuality from a female perspective. The author’s three subjects “stand for the whole of what longing in America looks like”; she spent time in their home towns to study their daily routines, jobs and, above all, their desires. With a novelist’s eye for detail, she captures the pain and powerlessness of sex, as well as its heady joys. 

A Month in Siena. By Hisham Matar. Random House; 126 pages; $27. Viking; £12.99 

The author’s life and writing have been shaped by his Libyan father’s kidnapping in 1990 by the regime of Muammar Qaddafi. In previous work he tried to uncover what happened; in this slim, bewitching book he finds answers, of a sort, by travelling to Siena. Meditating on art, history and the relationship between them, this is both a portrait of a city and an affirmation of life’s quiet dignities in the face of loss. 

This is Shakespeare. By Emma Smith. Pelican; 368 pages; £20 

A brilliant and accessible tour of Shakespeare’s plays that is also a radical manifesto for how to read and watch his work. Witty, irreverent and searching, this book, by a professor at Oxford University, shines dazzling new light on the oeuvre of the world’s greatest literary genius. 

Stalingrad: A Novel. By Vasily Grossman. Translated by Robert and Elizabeth Chandler. NYRB Classics; 1,088 pages; $27.95. Harvill Secker; £25 

At last, the Russian novelist-journalist’s mighty prequel to “Life and Fate”, his epic of the battle of Stalingrad and its aftermath, has received a definitive—and hugely powerful—English translation. A seething fresco of combat, domestic routine under siege and intellectual debate, it confirms that Grossman was the supreme bard of the second world war. 

Ducks, Newburyport. By Lucy Ellmann. Biblioasis; 1,040 pages; $22.95. Galley Beggar Press; £14.99 

The year’s unlikeliest literary triumph: a 1,000-page fictional monologue delivered by a worried Ohio housewife and baker, much of which is made up of a single sentence. A prize-garlanded novel that is funny, angry, erudite, profound—and full of great cake recipes. 

10 Minutes 38 Seconds in This Strange World. By Elif Shafak. Bloomsbury; 320 pages; $27. Viking; £14.99 

The protagonist of this story is dead when it begins. The body of “Tequila Leila” has been dumped in a wheelie bin on the outskirts of Istanbul; yet, somehow, her mind remains active. While it does, she scrolls back through her life—a pained childhood, stalwart friends in adulthood—in a powerful, unflinching novel that, like all of the Turkish author’s work, is political and lyrical at once. 

Homeland. By Fernando Aramburu. Translated by Alfred MacAdam. Pantheon; 608 pages; $29.95. Picador; £16.99 

A monumental novel—and a bestseller in Spanish—which explores how ETA’s terrorism divided families and lifelong friends in a claustrophobic Basque town. Empathetic but morally acute, this may be the definitive fictional account of the Basque troubles; it suggests that redemption is hard but not impossible. 

The Volunteer. By Salvatore Scibona. Penguin Press; 432 pages; $28. Jonathan Cape; £16.99 

This intricate novel spans decades and continents and incorporates multiple, looping stories. After being captured in Cambodia, Vollie returns to America and is dispatched to New York to conduct surveillance on a supposed renegade Nazi. This assignment will come to haunt him, too. “Who among us”, he asks, “has lived only once?” A searing yet poetic record of war and the lies people live by. 

The Far Field. By Madhuri Vijay. Grove Press; 448 pages; $27 and £14.99 

A courageous, insightful and affecting debut novel—and the winner of the prestigious JCB prize for Indian literature—which places a naive upper-class woman from southern India in the midst of far messier realities in Kashmir. Along the way, the story challenges Indian taboos ranging from sex to politics. 

Trust Exercise. By Susan Choi. Henry Holt; 272 pages; $27. Serpent’s Tail; £14.99 

The title of this tricksy, beguiling novel, winner of a National Book Award, refers to the relationship between writer and reader, as well as to the bonding exercises undertaken by the theatre students in the story—and to the trust between teenage girls and predatory men. A tale of missed connections and manipulation, and of willing surrender to the lure and peril of the unknown. 

Black Sun. By Owen Matthews. Doubleday; 320 pages; $26.95. Bantam Press; £16.99 

Based on real events—the bid by Andrei Sakharov to develop a bomb to end all bombs—this story is set in a secret Soviet city in 1961. Featuring murder and betrayals, and a flawed but principled KGB man as its hero, it unfolds in the aftermath of Stalinism, amid the scars left by the purges, denunciations and Great Patriotic War. The prolific author (see Biography), a former Moscow correspondent, knows his terrain inside out. 

The Uninhabitable Earth: Life After Warming. By David Wallace-Wells. Tim Duggan Books; 320 pages; $27. Allen Lane; £20 

One of the most persuasive of the many books that spell out the consequences of climate change—and one of the most terrifying. As Earth moves beyond the conditions that allowed people to evolve, the author warns, “the end of normal” has arrived. Yet amid the rising seas, floods, fires, droughts and hurricanes, both current and impending, he remains optimistic about humanity’s ability to deal with the havoc it has caused. 

The New Rules of War: Victory in the Age of Durable Disorder. By Sean McFate. William Morrow; 336 pages; $29.99 

A former paratrooper and mercenary makes the case that the American armed forces are ill-equipped for the conflicts of the 21st century. To keep the country safe, he contends, the top brass need to modernise their thinking, and respond to the information warfare that is now waged by their adversaries. 

Good Reasons for Bad Feelings. By Randolph Nesse. Dutton; 384 pages; $28. Allen Lane; £20 

A fascinating study of the evolutionary roots of mental illness. The author, a professor of psychiatry, argues that, in the right proportion, negative emotions may be useful for survival in a similar way to physical pain. Humans, he says, may have “minds like the legs of racehorses, fast but vulnerable to catastrophic failures”. 

Novacene: The Coming Age of Hyperintelligence. By James Lovelock with Bryan Appleyard. MIT Press; 160 pages; $22.95. Allen Lane; £14.99 

In a brief but thought-provoking book, the scientist who developed the “Gaia Theory” about the Earth’s life and climate—and who this year turned 100—predicts that cyborgs may eventually evolve to supplant carbon-based humankind. But don’t despair: the robots, he suggests, might decide to keep people around as pets.

<h3 id="７.2">To the Moon and back</h3>

Genesis. By Geoffrey Carr. Elsewhen Press; 285 pages; £9.99 

Our science editor’s debut novel is a techno-thriller in which computerised devices suddenly go [`haywire`](    "If something goes haywire, it goes out of control or starts doing the wrong thing. 失控的; 乱了套的"); scientists and researchers perish in a string of mysterious accidents; and a billionaire inventor schemes to colonise Mars. Meanwhile, deep in the Cloud, someone—or something—is watching the havoc unfold. 

Extreme Economies. By Richard Davies. Farrar, Straus and Giroux; 416 pages; $28. Bantam Press; £20 

An exploration of the lessons to be drawn from disaster-stricken economies and imperilled (but innovative) people, which ranges from the jungles of Panama to post-tsunami Indonesia to the prison system of Louisiana and Syrian refugee camps. By a former economics editor, now at the London School of Economics. 

The House on the Hill. By Christopher Impey. Tangerine Press; 215 pages; £14 

This history of Brixton prison (now 200 years old) recalls the stints behind its bars of Mick Jagger, Oswald Mosley and Bertrand Russell, and chronicles its place in criminal-justice policy, from [`treadmills`]( "You can refer to a task or a job as a treadmill when you have to keep doing it although it is unpleasant and exhausting. 单调的工作") to rehabilitation schemes. By a senior producer on “The Intelligence”, our daily podcast, who was formerly editor of National Prison Radio. 

The Moon: A History for the Future. By Oliver Morton. Hachette; 352 pages; $16.99. Economist Books; £20 

A multifaceted account of humankind’s past relationship with the Moon—from the imaginings of artists to the Apollo missions—and of its possible future, from space tourism to Moon-mining and (perhaps) human settlement. “Brilliant and compelling”, said the Sunday Times. “Engrossing”, reckoned the Washington Post. By our briefings editor.
