<h3 id="1.1">America’s decision to recognise Israeli settlements makes peace less likely</h3>

NOT LONG after Israel routed the Arab armies that surrounded it in 1967, Theodor Meron sent a “Top Secret” and “Extremely Urgent” memo to his bosses at the Israeli foreign ministry. Mr Meron, the ministry’s legal adviser, wrote that it would be illegal for Israel to settle the territory that it captured in the fighting. For decades that has also been the view of nearly all Israel’s allies. But Israel built scores of settlements anyway, so that 428,000 Israelis now live in the West Bank (not including East Jerusalem). Recognising that “reality on the ground”, Mike Pompeo, the American secretary of state, made a leap of legal logic on November 18th, saying the settlements were “not, `per se`<sup>本身</sup>, inconsistent with international law” (see article). 

This is merely the latest gift from President Donald Trump to Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister. Others have included recognising the disputed city of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and accepting its sovereignty over the occupied Golan Heights. These gestures seem intended to please Israel-loving evangelicals in America, and to boost Mr Netanyahu, a right-wing populist akin to Mr Trump. They also embolden Israeli annexationists, who want to take parts of the West Bank unilaterally. That would doom the two-state solution, whereby a Palestinian state would be created in the West Bank and Gaza. It would thus force Israel to make a dreadful choice about its future. 

Israel defends the settlements by noting that Jews have been in the West Bank for thousands of years. Their presence was recognised by the League of Nations in 1922. Moreover, Jordan’s right to rule over the land until 1967 was not widely recognised, and Palestinian sovereignty is disputed. So it is not clear whose land Israel is meant to be illegally occupying. And anyway the legal status of the settlements will be sorted out in a final agreement with the Palestinians, which is likely to include land swaps. Such arguments were enough to convince Ronald Reagan, an American president, that there was nothing inherently unlawful about the settlements, a position cited by Mr Pompeo. Other American administrations took to calling the settlements “illegitimate” rather than “illegal”. 

But the more convincing argument, made by Mr Meron and backed by the UN, the International Court of Justice and most legal scholars, is that the settlements violate the Fourth Geneva Convention, which `stipulates`<sup>规定</sup> that “the occupying power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies.” The reality on the ground that Mr Pompeo ignores is that 2.6m Palestinians live in the West Bank, which most of the world, and even past Israeli leaders, see as part of a future Palestinian state. “You may not like the word, but what is happening is an occupation; it is a disaster for Israel and the Palestinians,” said Ariel Sharon, then prime minister, in 2003. 

Mr Netanyahu, by contrast, courts the pro-settler crowd, who have helped him win four elections. In September he vowed to annex large parts of the West Bank, which no previous prime minister thought wise. Cynics dismissed this as a vote-getting stunt by a politician who is not really ready for annexation. But by giving the enthusiasts a green light, Mr Trump has hemmed in the prime minister—or whoever leads Israel next. The country is in political gridlock after an inconclusive election in September. If Mr Netanyahu forms a government, now or after another poll, he will come under pressure from his coalition to annex the land quickly, while Mr Trump is still in office. The prime minister, who wants his allies in the Knesset to shield him from prosecution on corruption charges, is in no position to resist. 

The settlements pose no less a challenge to Benny Gantz, whose Blue and White party won a plurality of seats. Mr Gantz, a former general who pummelled the Palestinians in Gaza, has failed to form a government of his own. He welcomed the announcement by Mr Pompeo, and may yet team up with some annexationists. But should he succeed in cobbling together a ruling coalition, he will have to grapple with the settlements, too. He has not presented any ideas for doing so. Nor has Mr Trump revealed his own long-promised plan for the “ultimate deal” between Israelis and Palestinians. 

The Trump administration may not realise it, but it is pushing Israel into a dangerous corner. It is not just that the settlements are “an obstacle to peace”, as even Reagan conceded, or that those deep within the West Bank are a financial and security burden on the Israeli state. They also challenge Israel’s character. 

Annexation could eat up so much land that what is left would not leave a coherent or functional Palestine. The resulting death of the two-state solution would present Israel with terrible options in the occupied territories. One path would be to give the Palestinians equal rights and watch as they matched or even outnumbered and outvoted the country’s Jewish population. Another would be to turn them into second-class citizens or corral them in Bantustans, both of which would turn Israel into a place with different laws for different peoples—an [`apartheid`](    "Apartheid was a political system in South Africa in which people were divided into racial groups and kept apart by law. 种族隔离制") state.

<h3 id="1.2">China’s unruly periphery resents the Communist Party’s heavy hand</h3>

A  FEW DAYS ago hundreds of young people, some teenagers, turned the redbrick campus of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University into a fortress. `Clad`<sup>穿衣的</sup> in black, their faces masked in black too, most of them remained [`defiant`]( "If you say that someone is defiant, you mean they show aggression or independence by refusing to obey someone. 挑战的; 蔑视的") as they came under siege. Police shot rubber bullets and jets of blue-dyed water at them. Defenders crouched over glass bottles, filling them with fuel and stuffing them with fuses to make bombs. Many cheered the news that an arrow shot by one of their archers had hit a policeman in the leg. After more than five months of anti-government unrest in Hong Kong, the stakes are turning deadly. 

This time, many exhausted protesters surrendered to the police—the youngest of them were given safe passage. Mercifully, massive bloodshed has so far been avoided. But Hong Kong is in peril (see article). As The Economist went to press, some protesters were refusing to leave the campus, and protests continued in other parts of the city. They attract nothing like the numbers who attended rallies at the outset—perhaps 2m on one occasion in June. But they often involve vandalism and Molotov cocktails. Despite the violence, public support for the protesters—even the bomb-throwing radicals—remains strong. Citizens may turn out in force for local elections on November 24th, which have taken on new significance as a test of the popular will and a chance to give pro-establishment candidates a drubbing. The government’s one concession—withdrawing a bill that would have allowed suspects to be sent to mainland China for trial—did little to restore calm. Protesters say they want nothing less than democracy. They cannot pick their chief executive, and elections for Hong Kong’s legislature are wildly tilted. So the protests may continue. 

The Communist Party in Beijing does not seem eager to get its troops to crush the unrest. Far from it, insiders say. This is a problem that the party does not want to own; the economic and political costs of mass-firing into crowds in a global financial centre would be huge. But own the problem it does. The heavy-handedness of China’s leader, Xi Jinping, and public resentment of it, is a primary cause of the turmoil. He says he wants a “great rejuvenation” of his country. But his brutal, uncompromising approach to control is feeding anger not just in Hong Kong but all around China’s periphery. 

When Mao Zedong’s guerrillas seized power in China in 1949, they did not take over a clearly defined country, much less an entirely willing one. Hong Kong was ruled by the British, nearby Macau by the Portuguese. Taiwan was under the control of the Nationalist government Mao had just overthrown. The mountain terrain of Tibet was under a Buddhist theocracy that chafed at control from Beijing. Communist troops had yet to enter another immense region in the far west, Xinjiang, where Muslim ethnic groups did not want to be ruled from afar.  

Seventy years on, the party’s struggle to establish the China it wants is far from over. Taiwan is still independent in all but name. In January its ruling party, which favours a more formal separation, is expected to do well once again in presidential and parliamentary polls. “Today’s Hong Kong, tomorrow’s Taiwan” is a popular slogan in Hong Kong that resonates with its intended audience, Taiwanese voters. Since Mr Xi took power in 2012 they have watched him chip away at Hong Kong’s freedoms and send warplanes on intimidating forays around Taiwan. Few of them want their rich, democratic island to be swallowed up by the dictatorship next door, even if many of them have thousands of years of shared culture with mainlanders. 

Tibet and Xinjiang are quiet, but only because people there have been terrorised into silence. After widespread outbreaks of unrest a decade ago, repression has grown overwhelming. In the past couple of years Xinjiang’s regional government has built a network of prison camps and incarcerated about 1m people, mostly ethnic Uighurs, often simply for being devout Muslims. Official Chinese documents recently leaked to the New York Times have confirmed the horrors unleashed there (see article). Officials say this “vocational training”, as they chillingly describe it, is necessary to eradicate Islamist extremism. In the long run it is more likely to fuel rage that will one day explode. 

The slogan in Hong Kong has another part: “Today’s Xinjiang, tomorrow’s Hong Kong”. Few expect such a grim outcome for the former British colony. But Hong Kongers are right to view the party with fear. Even if Mr Xi decides not to use troops in Hong Kong, his view of challenges to the party’s authority is clear. He thinks they should be crushed. 

This week America’s Congress passed a bill, nearly `unanimously`<sup>全体一致地</sup>, requiring the government to apply sanctions to officials guilty of abusing human rights in Hong Kong. Nonetheless, China is likely to lean harder on Hong Kong’s government, to explore whether it can pass a harsh new anti-sedition law, and to require students to submit to “patriotic education” (ie, party propaganda). The party wants to know the names of those who defy it, the better to make their lives miserable later. 

Mr Xi says he wants China to achieve its great rejuvenation by 2049, the 100th anniversary of Mao’s victory. By then, he says, the country will be “strong, democratic, culturally advanced, harmonious and beautiful”. More likely, if the party remains in power that long, Mao’s unfinished business will remain a terrible sore. Millions of people living in the outlying regions that Mao claimed for the party will be seething. 

Not all the Communist elite agree with Mr Xi’s clenched-fist approach, which is presumably why someone leaked the Xinjiang papers. Trouble in the periphery of an empire can swiftly spread to the centre. This is doubly likely when the peripheries are also where the empire rubs up against suspicious neighbours. India is wary of China’s militarisation of Tibet. China’s neighbours anxiously watch the country’s military build-up in the Taiwan Strait. A big fear is that an attack on the island could trigger war between China and America. The party cannot win lasting assent to its rule by force alone. 

In Hong Kong “one country, two systems” is officially due to expire in 2047. On current form its system is likely to be much like the rest of China’s long before then. That is why Hong Kong’s protesters are so desperate, and why the harmony Mr Xi talks so blithely of creating in China will elude him.

<h3 id="1.3">Silicon Valley is bad at making products that suit women. That is a missed opportunity</h3>

TAILORS WORKED out long ago that men and women have different shapes. Yet this message has failed to `penetrate`<sup>渗透</sup> many other areas of design. Car seatbelts, for example, which date back to the 1880s, are often still configured for men, who tend to sit farther back than women when driving. Most protective gear used by workers is designed for men’s bodies. And today the most forward-looking place on Earth—Silicon Valley—is still embedding old-school bias into new products. 

Consider virtual-reality headsets. Women are significantly more likely than men to feel sick when using them, perhaps because 90% of women have pupils that are closer together than the typical headset’s default setting (see article). This is not an isolated example. Most smartphones are too big to fit comfortably into the average woman’s hand, as are many video-game controllers. 

An obvious part of the explanation for Silicon Valley’s design problem is that men control most of its companies—male-run firms receive 82% of venture-capital (VC) funding—and entrepreneurs often build products to solve problems or address needs that affect them personally. Male bosses and entrepreneurs may be unaware of the problems women face. They may not flag up obvious areas of concern, or ask the right questions when doing their research (famously, Apple did not originally include menstrual-cycle tracking in its smartwatch, or in the iPhone’s Health app). 

Once an idea gets the green light it will then be handled by product-design and engineering teams, three-quarters of whose members are men. These teams often use data to make decisions, but lumping all users together means they may fail to spot trends based on sex differences. Reliance on historical data, and the sparsity of data on underrepresented groups, can also create bias in algorithms. Amazon binned a hiring algorithm that was persistently sexist, and Apple is being investigated over its new credit card, which offers women lower credit limits. 

Next comes testing. Naturally, designers test prototypes on their intended customers, but they may not get feedback from a broad enough group of people. There is also the risk of confirmation bias—designers may listen to what they want to hear, and discount negative reactions from some groups of users. 

Tech’s design bias needs fixing for ethical, safety and business reasons. The ethical imperative is obvious: it is wrong that women have to make do with a “one-size-fits-men” world, as Caroline Criado Perez, a writer, puts it. As for safety, regulators can tackle that by clamping down on things that are dangerous to women—including seatbelts—because they are not designed properly. 

But there is also a powerful business case for avoiding design bias, because huge opportunities are being missed. Women are 50% of the population, and make 70-80% of the world’s consumer-spending decisions. That means they control the deployment of more than $40trn a year. 

Change may be coming. The first voice-recognition systems struggled to understand female voices, but most now manage just fine. “Femtech” startups, which focus on women’s health and well-being, may raise $1bn by the end of this year. VC funds and tech firms are recruiting more women. Ensuring that products are designed for everyone would lead to happier and safer customers. For the companies that get it right, that means higher profits. What is holding them back?

<h3 id="1.4">Sri Lanka’s new president has a worrying past</h3>

AS SRI LANKA’S long civil war was drawing to a close in 2009, the army surrounded 100,000 civilians on a tiny sliver of beach, barely three square kilometres in size. Mixed in among them were a small number of separatist guerrillas, the remnants of a once-[`formidable`]( "If you describe something or someone as formidable, you mean that you feel slightly frightened by them because they are very great or impressive. 可怕的; 令人敬畏的") force that had been battling for an independent state for the country’s Tamil minority for 26 years. The insurgents had no `compunction`<sup>悔恨</sup> about using innocent villagers as human shields. The army claimed to have more scruples: it had designated the area a “no-fire zone”, where civilians could safely gather. Nonetheless, it continued to shell the beach mercilessly. The UN warned that a humanitarian disaster was unfolding and urged the government to declare a ceasefire, to no avail. In the end resistance crumbled and the army took control. But the beach was left piled with bodies, with more floating in the adjacent lagoon. The number of civilians who died in the final phase of the war, the UN concluded years later after a long investigation, was probably in the “tens of thousands”. 

Gotabaya Rajapaksa, the man who, as secretary of defence, presided over this horrifying episode, has just been elected president of Sri Lanka (see article). To Sinhalese Buddhists, about 70% of the population, he is a hero. After all, the militia he destroyed was appallingly cruel and bloodthirsty and had tormented Tamils as much as, if not more than, other Sri Lankans. To the 15% or so of the population that is Tamil, however, Mr Rajapaksa’s ends do not justify his means. In Jaffna, the biggest Tamil city, he won just 6% of the vote. 

Mr Rajapaksa tried to reassure minorities during the election campaign. He visited a mosque, for example, in a sop to the 10% of Sri Lankans who are Muslim. But Sinhalese groups with which he is closely aligned kept up a steady anti-Muslim diatribe, especially after suicide-bombings at several churches and hotels at Easter killed more than 250 people. Tellingly, the only district where Tamils are a minority that Mr Rajapaksa failed to carry was Ampara, where Muslims are the biggest group. 

When asked about the past, Mr Rajapaksa `parries`<sup>回避</sup>, saying that it is more important to think about the future. People in his circle admit that he made mistakes, but promise that he will do things differently this time. Many businessmen, in particular, are thrilled at the outcome of this election. They are hoping for a period of decisive economic management, after four years of bickering and dithering. 

It may be that Mr Rajapaksa proves a good economic manager, although the record of his brother, Mahinda, who was president from 2005 to 2015 and whom Gotabaya intends to appoint as prime minister, was mixed. Sri Lanka certainly needs to get on with post-war reconstruction, which has proceeded `distressingly`<sup>令人苦恼地</sup> slowly and would benefit from a more efficient, driven government. 

For the most part, though, Sri Lanka does not need a strongman. It has been remarkably peaceful for a decade, despite the carnage at Easter. If there is a pressing concern about security, beyond the hunt for terrorists, it is that the sort of Sinhalese nationalists at whom Mr Rajapaksa has been winking will resort to mob violence. Anti-Muslim riots have taken place not only after the bombings this year, but also in 2014 and 2018. 

The election results show that Sri Lanka is still ethnically polarised. If Mr Rajapaksa really wants to demonstrate that he is a changed man, he should start by reassuring minorities. It is encouraging that he has said he sees himself as president for all Sri Lankans, not just those who voted for him. But for every gesture of unity, there has been a contrary, sectarian one. For example, Mr Rajapaksa chose to be sworn in at a Buddhist temple. 

The end of the war, however bloody, held out the hope of a peaceful and prosperous future for all Sri Lankans. It would be tragic if Mr Rajapaksa undermined his own achievement by inflaming the divisions of the past.

<h3 id="1.5">Tackling America’s giant hospital bill</h3>


THE HEALTH-CARE system in America has long suffered from two grave problems. The first is that not enough people have reasonable access to medical treatment if they fall ill. President Barack Obama tackled this with his landmark reforms in 2010, which succeeded in extending coverage to some 20m Americans who previously lacked insurance. Mr Obama cut a deal with America’s powerful health-care lobbies and built a grand coalition for reform that included hospitals, insurers and Big Pharma. The law was passed after an epic battle in Congress. 

Unfortunately, since that success the second problem—[`exorbitant`](    "If you describe something such as a price or fee as exorbitant, you are emphasizing that it is much higher than it should be. (价格、费用) 过高的") costs—has spiralled even further out of control. Health spending has risen from 17.3% of GDP before Obamacare was passed to 17.9% today. The average figure for rich countries is 9%. Now President Donald Trump is aiming to slay the monster. On November 15th he announced plans to require hospitals and insurance firms to disclose the true prices they charge. More transparency is a vital step in ending the health-care racket. But the plan will not work unless there is also a drive to boost competition in rigged local hospital markets. 

Mr Trump has correctly identified a big villain behind health-care cost inflation, and it is not Big Pharma. Hospitals account for over 30% of health-care spending, whereas drugs account for less than 15%. Add in doctors and related professional services, and the share rises to over half. Hospital costs have been climbing by roughly 5% a year of late, compared with 1% for drugs. 

This reflects pricing strategies that make Mount Rushmore look transparent. Patients and their insurance firms pay for advice and procedures provided by practitioners and hospitals. Exactly how much is a lottery. A mammogram can cost $150 or $550 in Philadelphia, depending on which provider you choose, but your hospital and insurer will not tell you that price in advance. A scan of your lower back can cost just $150 in Louisiana but more than $7,500 in California. Insurers receive big—but secret—discounts on list prices from hospitals and doctors. 

Patients who are `fed up`<sup>感到厌烦的</sup> have little choice. The hospital industry has consolidated in a wave of more than 680 mergers since 2010 (see article). Many cities and regions are dominated by one or two big hospital operators. A recent study found that, by a standard measure, over three-quarters of hospital markets rank as “highly concentrated”. Hospital chains have also been acquiring physicians’ practices in order to create large, vertically integrated health-care outfits that dominate their local market. Privately run hospital firms thrive on opacity and consolidation, which boost earnings. The motives of non-profit hospital organisations that are `ostensibly`<sup>表面上</sup> run in the public interest are harder to fathom, but presumably some want to expand their empires and to boost revenues so that they can pay their senior medical staff and managers more. 

In order to create more transparency, Mr Trump’s new rules mean that hospitals will say what they really charge insurance companies by 2021 and will create a price list for 300 or so common procedures, to allow patients to shop around. Insurance firms will have to make public the actual prices they are charged for services, after they have negotiated discounts. The rule changes do not need approval from Congress, although they will probably be challenged in the courts. 

It is a good start, but reform needs to go further. Health care is not a normal market. Consumers are often not price-sensitive—you do not haggle during a heart attack. People with decent insurance plans are not directly on the hook for the vast majority of their costs. And the industry’s cosy structure means that transparency could backfire. For example, rather than expensive hospitals cutting prices, cheap ones in a market without competition might raise theirs instead, once they realise just how much insurers have been willing to pay. 

Mr Trump should build on an innovative experiment in California that uses reference pricing to encourage patients to choose less expensive providers or insist that hospitals benchmark their prices to those in the most efficient and competitive hospital markets. The government also needs to stiffen the daily penalties for hospitals that fail to comply with the new rules beyond the current, paltry $300 fine. 

At the same time a big drive is needed to inject more competition into local hospital markets. This means blocking more medical mergers and may ultimately require unwinding deals that have already happened, in order to ensure that patients have a genuine choice. This in turn may demand new laws that reboot America’s rickety antitrust regulators. As in other consolidating industries, from airlines to telecoms, they have let the public down with dire consequences. 

Mr Trump deserves credit for taking on a demon that none of his predecessors dared to touch. But transparency will not count for much unless it is accompanied by strong and creative efforts to weaken the grip of America’s medical oligopolies.

<h3 id="2.1">Hong Kong stares into the abyss amid growing violence</h3>

SINCE THE middle of November, Hong Kong has been staring into the abyss. The violence attending its nearly six-month-old protest movement—both its participants, approvingly, and China’s central government, furiously, brand it a revolution—has stepped up a gear. Police have increased their use of tear-gas, rubber bullets and water cannon. Protesters who once carried nothing more offensive than an umbrella now wield bows and specialise in petrol bombs. Vigilante violence has flourished. The first deaths—a student who fell running from the police and a street-cleaner hit by a brick apparently thrown by a protester—have been recorded. 

On November 17th, in the most dramatic `stand-off`<sup>僵局</sup> yet, the police began moving against protesters at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) who were mass-producing Molotov cocktails. The protesters barricaded themselves in. Riot police tasked with getting them out threatened to use lethal force in doing so. 

The fears which that provoked have [`waned`](   "If something wanes, it becomes gradually weaker or less, often so that it eventually disappears. 减弱; 减少"). International calls for the police to stay their hand may have contributed to a decision to wait for the protesters to emerge—as many have, cold, tired, hungry and frightened. Thanks to mediation by social workers and a few local politicians, 300 protesters under the age of 18 were allowed to leave, though their personal details were carefully taken down. Others have made dramatic escapes. But as The Economist went to press 60 or so remained behind the barricades. Before making his own escape Mok, a 23-year-old graduate, told our correspondent that, “Even if we are dying on the campus or in the underground tunnels, we are not going to surrender.” With the language of martyrdom abroad, the risk of a bloody ending remains. 

The violence of the Hong Kong protests, and of the response to them, is hardly remarkable by international standards. Much worse has happened in Baghdad, Beirut, Santiago and Tehran over the past months. But by the standards of both Hong Kong and China’s Communist Party, these events are shocking. No one would have predicted in May that a proposed change to the territory’s extradition laws could lead to a sustained rebellion lit by burning vehicles. For one thing, China seldom treats rebellion with anything less than dire repression. For another, Hong Kongers tend not to see themselves as revolutionaries. But that, it seems, is changing. The protesters are willing to use violence in the service of decency and their way of life—to burn universities in order to save them. 

Hong Kong has never been a democracy. But in the later years of British rule its Legislative Council (Legco) gradually became more representative of the people. The territory’s courts enjoyed genuine independence, and its citizens a free press. As well as boasting one of the world’s most vigorous economies, the territory bore most of the hallmarks of a free society. 

Today, Hong Kong’s local district councils, for which elections are due to be held on November 24th, are the only tier of government chosen entirely through universal [`suffrage`](    "Suffrage is the right of people to vote for a government or national leader. 选举权"). But when China reclaimed the territory in 1997 it agreed that its form of government, courts, free press, trade relations, financial system and way of life should remain unchanged for 50 years: “one country, two systems”, in the phrase of Deng Xiaoping, then China’s leader. Though some of the territory’s autonomy was eroded in the 2000s, China largely kept to the deal, its concerns over excessive freedoms offset by a thriving economy and, to some extent, the [`opprobrium`](  "Opprobrium is open criticism or disapproval of something that someone has done. 公开指责; 公开反对") it would face should it break its word. 

But around the time that Xi Jinping, China’s current leader, came to power in 2012, the rate of erosion quickened. The government in Beijing pushed for a highly unpopular programme of “patriotic education” at schools to engender loyalty—a push that did not succeed, but still self-defeatingly contributed to the radicalisation of some of the territory’s young people. Proposed reforms that would have let Hong Kongers choose their chief executive, but in effect restricted the choice to a slate picked by Beijing, led to the Occupy Central protests of late 2014. 

This year the issue originally at stake was a bill which would have allowed anyone in Hong Kong accused of a crime in mainland China to be tried there—which is to say, in a system Beijing controls. Outrage at this new erosion brought 1m people on to the streets. Carrie Lam, the territory’s chief executive, ignored them. Her intransigence led to even larger protests. Organisers claim that a demonstration on June 16th brought 2m on to the streets—a turnout almost ten times larger than Martin Luther King’s March on Washington provided by a population less than a twentieth that of America in 1963. Civil servants, church groups, executives and the staff of Hong Kong’s biggest employers all joined in, as did teenagers, children and babes in arms. 

The heart of the protests, though, was to be found among young, well-educated Hong Kongers fighting for their city’s democratic autonomy. For most of them that fight was, to begin with, metaphorical. For some—those now known as the frontliners—it was not. They looked back on the non-violent protests of Occupy Central when, as Joshua Wong, one of Occupy’s leaders, put it, the police had arrested “anyone with a megaphone” and learned their lesson: they would be leaderless, anonymous and comfortable with violence. 

In “Longstreet”, a 1970s television programme, Bruce Lee tells his student “to be formless, shapeless—like water”; to take whatever form the circumstances require; to flow, creep, drip or crash. “Be water” became the movement’s [`watchword`](  "Someone's watchword is a word or phrase that sums up their attitude or approach to a particular subject or to things in general. 口号; 格言"), votes on encrypted messaging apps its leaderless model of co-ordination. 

The frontliners’ early forays beyond previous norms—blocking roads with pavement railings and shouting taunts at the police—now seem, by their own admission, almost quaint. Direct clashes were few. The storming of Legco on July 1st, and the subsequent daubing of its chamber with slogans, shocked the authorities and some of the populace. But the writing on the walls was in paint, not blood. 

Other symbolic gestures were more `aesthetically`<sup>审美地</sup> pleasing. A remarkably catchy, crowdsourced Cantonese anthem, “Glory to Hong Kong”, first heard at rallies, ended up sung by flash mobs of office workers during lunch breaks. A moment when a young girl and boy, forming a human chain, found themselves too shy to hold hands and instead gripped the two ends of a biro took flight on social media; within a day it had been mashed up with Michaelangelo into memes showing the spark of life, or freedom, flowing from one to the other. The “Goddess of Democracy” who graced the Tiananmen Square protests—herself a repurposing of the Statue of Liberty—appeared again, now known as “Lady Liberty” and kitted out with the practical but now also iconic appurtenances of protest: hard hat, gas mask and umbrella. 

The police met the water’s rising tide with what in retrospect seems like tolerance. When, three weeks after the storming of Legco, the frontliners painted slogans on the Liaison Office, symbol of the Chinese Communist Party’s authority over Hong Kong, the police were furious at having been outwitted. Yet when The Economist asked one officer what he and his colleagues near the office intended to do in the face of protesters barricading the road, he replied, with a wry smile: “Wait till the MTR [the underground system] closes and protesters take the last train home.” 

Elsewhere on the MTR, though, that night saw a decisive escalation. Men with triad links and metal staffs entered the Yuen Long station in the New Territories looking for democracy protesters on trains. They laid into passengers indiscriminately; local police, apparently turning a blind eye, failed to respond. That incident did more than any other to discredit a police force that used to be called “Asia’s finest”. Today, only Mrs Lam uses the phrase. 

Since then protesters have vandalised (or, in protest slang, “renovated”) state banks, Hong Kong’s biggest bookseller (which is owned by the Liaison Office) and restaurants with sympathies assumed to lie with the Communist Party. Rioters now set fires not only on the streets but inside buildings. On November 6th a pro-establishment politician with known links to the triads in Yuen Long was stabbed in broad daylight. People fear being attacked simply on the basis of being Mandarin-speaking mainland Chinese. Nihilism is trumping romanticism: “If we burn, you burn with us”, a rebel slogan from the climax of the Hunger Games saga, has gained currency. Earlier this month it was given `awful`<sup>可怕的</sup> form when a bystander confronting protesters was doused with something flammable and set on fire (he survived). 

Police commanders express bewilderment that the mass of ordinary, peace-loving Hong Kongers are not repelled by such scenes on the streets. Many are. But they are repelled yet more by the police. A survey published on November 15th by the Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute found that 83% blame the government, and especially the police, for the increase in violence. In a separate poll, 51.5% reported zero trust in the police force, up from just 6.5% before the protests began. 

Hong Kongers are appalled that police have lined uniformed schoolchildren against walls for random searches and have arrested 11-year-olds. Reports are growing of physical mistreatment in detention. Rules of engagement that in July were consistent with best international practice—rubber bullets fired only below waist height, tear-gas used to disperse not to kettle—have been thrown out of the window. Beatings at the time of arrest have become commonplace, sometimes escalating to frenzy. On November 11th an unarmed protester was shot in the stomach at point-blank range. And all this with impunity. Officially, only one officer out of over 30,000 has as yet been suspended for any action against a protester. 

It is possible to see a terrible symmetry at work, with frontline ninjas in helmets with camera mounts uncannily resembling the black-clad police of the rapid-action unit known as the Raptors. Each side’s epithets dehumanise the other—“dogs” for the police, “cockroaches” for the protesters. The litanies of brutality they recite match each other crime for crime. But a large part of the public, from taxi drivers to secretaries, sees no such balance. On October 1st, China’s national day, residents of high rises in Wanchai concealed hundreds of protesters suddenly cornered by riot police. Crowds scream at riot police in shopping malls and housing estates. Asia’s finest have become haak ging—“black police”. 

Police commanders blame Mrs Lam and her administration for forcing them to deal with the ever-worse symptoms of a problem which can only be sorted out politically. But Dennis Kwok, who represents the legal profession in Legco, says the police now take direct orders from central-government officials. Chris Tang Ping-keung, who was installed as police commissioner on November 19th, immediately changed the force’s motto from serving with “Pride and Care”—which aligned it with the citizens to whom it is nominally accountable—to serving with “Duty and Loyalty”. That will play well in Beijing. 

China’s official narrative about Hong Kong is that Western “black hands” are training, organising and even paying protesters to destroy Hong Kong—part of a larger plot to hold down a rising China. When America’s Senate passed a bill supportive of the protesters on November 20th Beijing reacted with a fury that grew out of and fed that narrative. Many mainlanders, bombarded by state media with images of protesters insulting China or waving foreign flags, long to see the protests crushed. 

The Chinese government is clear that it wants things sorted. But it has held back from sending in the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) and paramilitary police to quell the disturbances—indeed, though one can never know what a secretive leadership is planning, it may never seriously have been considered. In leaked comments from a private meeting with businessmen, Mrs Lam implied that China’s threats had been so much bluster. One of her advisers says that, although the protests represent a big loss of face to China’s leadership, the loss of face that would come with abandoning all semblance of “one country, two systems” would be worse. 

For a government that makes much of its decisiveness under the brilliant leadership of Xi Jinping, the absence of anything resembling a strategy to sort out Hong Kong is striking. The best spin that officials can put on it is that their leaders are playing a long game, waiting for popular sentiment to turn against the protesters and reconcile itself to something like the status quo ante. This seems unlikely—but possibly looks more plausible if you sincerely believe, as hardliners say they do, that Hong Kong opinion polls cannot be trusted because they are conducted by universities and think-tanks that are `hotbeds`<sup>温床</sup> of Western liberalism, and if your view of the territory has long been coloured by reports from Liaison Office officials who tell you what you want to hear. 

A deeper problem is that the government in Beijing has `pre-emptively`<sup>先发制人地</sup> undercut the possibility of a satisfactory settlement. As the Hong Kong police argue in private, the unrest needs a political solution. But the Communist Party has systematically constrained the space in which the give and take of Hong Kong politics can take place. Those constraints created the dissatisfaction that led to the protests; coming to some accommodation would require setting some of them aside. But China’s leadership is unwilling to countenance such action. An example: when Hong Kong’s high court overturned a ban on face coverings imposed by Mrs Lam, the National People’s Congress in Beijing made its disapproval clear. 

If expecting politics to work in a place where they have tried to remove that possibility fails, China’s leaders “have no Plan B,” according to a senior adviser to Mrs Lam with close links to Beijing. And so things are left in the hands of Mrs Lam and her paralysed, incompetent government. Mrs Lam is showing the same intransigence in the face of calls for an independent investigation into the causes of the unrest and into police behaviour as she originally did over the extradition bill. When in an unaccustomed fit of good sense she acknowledged the need to reach out to young people, she did so at a youth camp organised by the reviled PLA—and in the Mandarin of the overlord rather than Cantonese. 

With no one in power taking the initiative and violence ratcheting up, the outlook appears grim. But the district-council elections set for November 24th could possibly help move the action away from the streets. These elections, mostly concerned with rubbish collection and the management of public housing estates, have never previously been a big deal. This time democrats see them as an opportunity to show that the energy of the streets can be channelled into the ballot box. 

With a democrat contesting every council seat and 386,000 (mainly young) new voters, the poll offers the chance for a symbolic coup de théâtre and, indirectly, a shift in the composition of Legco. Half of the committee’s 70 members are directly elected—six of the others come from the district councils. The election results will also affect the make-up of the committees, tightly [`circumscribed`]( "If someone's power or freedom is circumscribed, it is limited or restricted. 限制") by Beijing, which every five years choose the chief executive. 

It might seem strange, in the current circumstances, that the elections are going ahead. But both sides want them. Mok, the protester behind the barricades at PolyU, says that though he views the elections as part of the tainted system he is fighting, he and his comrades are determined to vote. The government, for its part, desperately wants to show that some things are carrying on as normal. And for the elections to go ahead, it says it needs calm. This puts democratic leaders in something of a spot. They need the frontliners to leave the barricades—yet saying so out loud would risk splitting the protest movement. 

When his pupil in “Longstreet” worries that wateriness does not sound like the way to beat his fearsome opponent, Bruce Lee [`upbraids`](   "If you upbraid someone, you tell them that they have done something wrong and criticize them for doing it. 责骂") him: “You want to learn the way to win, but never accept the way to lose.” The Hong Kong protesters know that they are not going to win a liberal democracy any time soon. But nor do they necessarily need to follow Lee’s last advice: that the pupil must learn the art of dying. Some in Beijing acknowledge that a fundamental change has taken place in Hong Kong, and suggest that the central government will be “very cautious” about its next steps. In response to the suggestion that the Communist Party had lost the hearts and minds of a whole generation in Hong Kong, one thoughtful person in the capital said: “Oh, two.” That is the case for giving Hong Kong the political space to start sorting out the mess itself. It is not a case Mr Xi is likely to take to. But some waters flow slowly.

<h3 id="3.1">Fossil-fuel-producing countries say one thing and do another</h3>

AT A SUMMIT in Paris in 2015, 188 countries pledged to `curb`<sup>抑制</sup> their greenhouse-gas emissions. Collectively, these pledges, known as “nationally determined contributions” or NDCs, fall well short of what is needed to achieve another part of the Paris agreement, which is to avoid more than 2°C of warming above pre-industrial temperature levels. A report by the United Nations Environment Programme finds, however, that even these unambitious targets will probably be missed. Researchers studied policy documents from big fossil-fuel-producing countries to calculate how much coal, oil and natural gas is likely to be extracted over the next 20 years. According to these documents, global CO2 emissions from fossil fuels will reach 41 gigatonnes by 2040. That is higher than the 36 gigatonnes implied by the NDCs—and well above the 19 gigatonnes needed to keep warming below 2°C.

<h3 id="3.2">Nematode parasites kill a lot of sheep</h3>

CROWD ANIMALS together and one likely outcome is parasitic infestation. This has been a problem since the beginning of animal husbandry. Many scholars, for instance, suspect that the origins of religious dietary laws forbidding the consumption of pig meat lie in pigs’ susceptibility to worms that are harmful to human beings. But they are also harmful to animals. They are, for example, the largest cause of natural death among the world’s sheep. 

Nowadays, at least where farmers have access to modern `veterinary`<sup>兽医</sup> facilities, the usual approach to `infestation`<sup>感染</sup> is to administer vermicidal drugs (see picture). These often work. But, as with any such approach to parasites and pathogens, extensive use has encouraged the evolution of resistance. Many worms have become immune to at least one of the commonly used vermicides. Some are immune to all three. 

What has not been tried until recently is to apply the principles of selective breeding that are employed to improve meat, milk, wool and hide production to the question of parasite control. That has changed with work done in Britain by Hannah Vineer at the University of Bristol and Eric Morgan at Queen’s University Belfast. As they report in the International Journal for Parasitology, selective breeding of sheep for resistance to nematode-worm infestation works. And, crucially, it works without detriment to the desirable characteristics of lamb weight, ewe weight and milk yield. 

That worms like nematodes are, to human sensibilities, [`revolting`](   "If you say that something or someone is revolting, you mean you think they are horrible and disgusting. 令人厌恶的") creatures with revolting lives is surely the result of millions of years of co-evolution that has favoured avoiding any contact with them. Infestation starts when a host accidentally consumes a nematode’s eggs. The parasites then hatch, grow and mature in the host’s stomach or intestines, where they consume nutrients which that host would otherwise absorb. Once mature, they release eggs that are broadcast into the world in the host’s `faeces`<sup>粪便</sup>, and the cycle starts again. 

Dr Vineer and Dr Morgan knew from earlier work that the number of eggs so broadcast varies a lot from animal to animal. This led them to wonder if selectively mating together individuals that passed few eggs in their faeces, and so seemed resistant to infestation, might result in strains that were parasite-free. 

To find out, they teamed up with two farmers in south-west England who had already been experimenting informally with such breeding programmes. Following up on a decade of this informal work, farmers and academics spent a further four years systematising and recording in detail what was happening. They discovered that the approach worked. On one farm the faecal nematode-egg count per animal dropped by a quarter. On the other it fell by a third. In neither case were desirable characteristics of body weight or milk yield harmed. 

Falls in infestation of a quarter to a third are not as dramatic as those caused by vermicides. However, the hostile physiological environment that has brought about such falls is likely to have many dimensions, making it harder to evolve around than the toxic effect of a single drug molecule—or even three of them. So, though this is a small pilot study, it certainly looks worth following up. If larger investigations confirm Dr Vineer’s and Dr Morgan’s findings, then explicitly breeding sheep, and possibly other livestock, for parasite resistance would seem a good idea. Animals would start out healthier and would need less worming-by-drug. And that would make resistance to those drugs less likely to evolve in the first place.

<h3 id="3.3">New ways to make molybdenum-99</h3>

ONE FEAR raised by those who oppose Britain’s leaving the European Union without a deal is that the import of radioactive `isotopes`<sup>同位素</sup> for medicine would be at risk. These short-lived substances might, people worry, encounter bureaucratic obstacles that slowed down their delivery and thus increased the fraction lost to radioactive `decay`<sup>衰退</sup>. 

Particular concern surrounds molybdenum-99 (99Mo), the [`workhorse`](   "If you describe a person or a machine as a workhorse, you mean that they can be relied upon to do a large amount of work, especially work that is dull or routine. 吃苦耐劳的人") of diagnostic nuclear-imaging. 99Mo, which has a half-life of just 66 hours, decays into a substance called technetium-99m (99mTc) that has a half-life of six hours. 99mTc emits gamma rays, so its location in the body is easy to see using appropriate cameras. And it can be incorporated into a variety of chemicals, called radiopharmaceuticals, that accumulate `preferentially`<sup>优先地</sup> in different bodily organs. This lets doctors observe what is going on in those organs. About 80% of diagnostic nuclear-imaging of this kind involves 99mTc, so without a continuous supply of 99Mo to make it from, this whole branch of medicine would grind to a halt. 

For American doctors, who carry out 40,000 scans a day involving 99mTc, the threat is not hypothetical. In 2009 America’s clinics and hospitals were cut off for several weeks from their main supplier, Canadian Nuclear Laboratories, by a leak that caused the shutdown of the reactor used to make the isotope. Last year the cut-off became permanent when the reactor was closed. There are other manufacturers, but they are in Europe, South Africa and Australia. So the American government is encouraging new ones to step in—and is sponsoring new ways to make the stuff. 

The current process bombards uranium enriched in a `fissile`<sup>分裂性的</sup> isotope, 235U, with high-velocity neutrons from a reactor. Absorbing a neutron causes an atom of 235U to split in two (the same process lies at the heart of nuclear power stations and uranium atom bombs). 99Mo is a common product of this fission, and can be separated chemically from the bombarded uranium with reasonable ease. 

Some people, however, think they have better ways to make 99Mo—ways that do not involve a reactor. Niowave, a firm in Lansing, Michigan, is one such. Instead of neutrons, its researchers are firing high-velocity electrons at enriched uranium. They speed the electrons up to something approaching that of light using a machine called a linear accelerator, then launch them into a uranium target, splitting its 235U atoms, after which 99Mo can be extracted from the target in the normal way. 

Niowave’s accelerator employs superconductivity to generate the powerful electric currents needed to achieve all this. That requires a suitable material, niobium, to carry the current, and a suitable temperature, that of liquid helium, to make the niobium superconducting. 

Mike Zamiara, Niowave’s boss, says the firm has already made test batches of 99Mo. The company plans to pump up the volume over the next few years. The aim is to reach commercial levels in 2025. By 2026, Mr Zamiara says, Niowave should be able to supply 40% of American demand. 

Phoenix, a firm in Monona, Wisconsin, plans to make 99Mo more conventionally—by neutron bombardment. The unconventional part of its approach is the neutrons’ source. Instead of a fission reactor, Phoenix employs a small-scale version of a process that some hope will one day lead to fusion reactors (and which already lies at the heart of hydrogen bombs). Like Niowave’s, this method starts with a particle accelerator. The particles accelerated, though, are not electrons but deuterons. 

A deuteron is the atomic nucleus of a type of heavy hydrogen called deuterium, and consists of a proton and a neutron. Phoenix’s neutron generators fire deuterons into chambers full of tritium, an even heavier form of hydrogen that has a proton and two neutrons as its nucleus. A high-speed collision between a deuteron and a tritium nucleus causes the two to fuse, creating helium (two protons and two neutrons) and spitting out a neutron. Properly tweaked, such a neutron generator can produce 46 trillion of the particles a second. 

Evan Sengbusch, Phoenix’s president, says the company is supplying eight accelerators for a new isotope factory to be run by its collaborator, SHINE Medical of Janesville, also in Wisconsin. SHINE’s boss, Greg Piefer, says the facility will be finished in 2021, with the first production shortly thereafter. By 2023, he hopes, SHINE will be the biggest supplier of 99Mo in the world.

<h3 id="3.4">Solar-powered trains could make rail transport greener</h3>

COMMUTERS MAY not have paid them much attention, but a small array of solar panels next to the railway line at Aldershot, a town 50km (30 miles) south-west of London, could `herald`<sup>预兆</sup> a greener future for train travel. The site is an experiment to supply electricity generated from sunlight directly to a railway line. It is the “directly” bit that is novel. In Britain, as in many places, solar power is already fed into the grid, and it is the grid which train operators plug into. So, in a sense, many electric trains already use some solar power. But by connecting the panels to the line itself, trains can be powered more efficiently. 

Admittedly, it is not at present a lot of power. At around 37 kilowatts the site could easily top up the battery of a Tesla electric car, but it might not move an electric train very far. That does not matter at this stage, because it is there to test a concept rather than run a railway. And the concept is working, says Stuart Kistruck, director of engineering for the southern region of Network Rail, the government-owned operator of railway infrastructure in Britain. 

Network Rail is working on the project in collaboration with Imperial College, London, and Riding Sunbeams, a not-for-profit company set up by climate activists to promote locally owned renewable-energy projects. The plan now is to scale up the idea and roll it out elsewhere. 

Connecting up the Aldershot site was made easier by a quirk of history. When the electrification of Britain’s railways began in the late 19th century, two systems were used. In much of the country overhead lines were installed, but in crowded south-east England a “third rail” was used instead. This consists of a conductor rail placed alongside the track on insulated brackets. A pickup shoe near the wheels of the train draws power from this rail. 

Third-rail systems tend to be employed in urban railways because they are easier and cheaper than making tunnels and bridges large enough to accommodate overhead cables—and the railway lines of southern Britain have plenty of low bridges and tunnels. For safety and other reasons, third-rail systems typically operate at 750 volts DC, a much lower voltage than overhead lines, which in Britain run at 25 kilovolts AC. As it happens, solar arrays typically put out DC current at 600-800 volts, which reduces the complexity and cost of connecting them to the railway line. Another convenience is that, to reduce transmission losses, third-rail networks have more closely spaced substations. These provide handy feed-in points for lineside solar power. 

One problem facing groups like Riding Sunbeams is that electricity grids are rarely designed to accept power from small and varied sources, so feed-in arrangements can be hard to set up. A passing railway line, however, provides an alternative, says Leo Murray, the company’s director. Along with Network Rail, Riding Sunbeams has drawn up a list of other sites that might be suitable for larger installations. 

Apart from green PR, what does Network Rail get out of this? First, there is a lot of unused land next to railway lines, where solar panels could be placed. Those panels would also shade [`vegetation`](  "Plants, trees, and flowers can be referred to as vegetation. 植物"), reducing its growth and the amount of cutting-back required. The “leaves on the line” excuse for late-running trains is a bit of a joke in Britain, but the slippery conditions leaves cause for train wheels are a big problem. 

Second, it is a good deal. Lineside solar electricity will be cheaper than that from the grid, Mr Kistruck calculates. Overall, he reckons, 10% of the southern region’s power needs might be met this way. Such savings are not to be sniffed at. With around 40% of the country’s rail system electrified, Network Rail is Britain’s biggest single user of electricity. It has an annual bill of around £300m ($390m) just for traction. 

The idea could also be employed elsewhere, and not just on urban lines. With additional work it might be adapted for overhead-powered systems as well. It looks particularly promising in countries beyond cloudy Britain. India, for instance, is keen on using solar power to electrify its rail system. Indian Railways has been fitting solar panels onto the roofs of some train carriages. They are still pulled by dirty diesel-powered locomotives, but the panels run the lights, fans and information displays, which saves some fuel. 

The limited space available for solar panels on train roofs means that not enough power could be produced to `propel`<sup>推进</sup> an entire train. However, the Byron Bay Train, a heritage railway near Brisbane, Australia, comes close. It is a two-car unit that runs entirely on energy from solar panels on its roof and on the roof of its shed. The converted train, originally dating from 1949, can carry 96 passengers on a route just 3km long—but in a part of the world blessed with plenty of sunshine. London’s commuters have no such luck.

<h3 id="3.5">Virtual reality continues to make people sick</h3>

THE WHOLE history of fiction shows that alternative realities are an attractive and profitable idea. So back in the 1990s, when electronics had arrived at a point where people could build headsets that blocked off actual reality and replaced it with a virtual version created inside a computer, it looked as if something world-changing might have arrived. Games companies were particularly excited, and Nintendo, Sega and Virtuality duly piled in. 

The world, however, stubbornly refused to be changed. It might have put up with the low-resolution images, the choppy scene transitions and the poor controls, for these would surely have got better. It might also have put up with the price (the headsets in question could cost up to $70,000), for that would surely have come down. It could not, though, accommodate the dizziness, nausea, eye strain, vomiting, headaches, sweating and disorientation that many of the technology’s users (more than 60%, according to one study) complained of—a set of symptoms that, collectively, have come to be called “cyber-sickness”. Though not fatal to people, cyber-sickness certainly helped damage the industry, which more or less vanished. 

Two decades later, however, virtual reality (VR) returned from the dead, with better images, smoother transitions and more precise controls. There were also applications beyond games. The upgraded technology has found use in social media, interior design, job training and even pain management. Moreover, a new set of companies, Oculus (now part of Facebook), HTC and Sony, have come up with products that do not require a second mortgage to afford. 

Despite these improvements, though, VR has not lived up to expectations. It has done respectably, with sales in 2018 of $3.6bn, according to SuperData Research, a market research firm. But that is only 2.4% of the global market for games. Many people—and not just the usual hypesters—thought that this time around VR would become a [`blockbuster`](    "A blockbuster is a film or book that is very popular and successful, usually because it is very exciting. 大片; 畅销书") technology. It has not happened. Part of the reason is that cyber-sickness has not gone away. One study suggests between 25% and 40% of users still experience it. 

Dealing with this is difficult, not least because there is an argument about what triggers it in the first place. Two theories dominate. One is that users experience sensory conflict—a mismatch between what they see and what their other senses and their real-world knowledge tell them they should be experiencing. The other is that the underlying cause is individuals’ inability to control their bodies and maintain proper posture when moving around in virtual environments. To complicate matters, both hypotheses could be true. 

Sensory conflict there certainly is. For example, when users move their heads they expect what they see to change immediately in response. But time-lags and poor graphics mean their visual input often fails to meet the brain’s expectations. Dealing with this means increasing the “frame rate” at which the virtual world is presented to a user, improving the resolution of the images and reducing the latency of response to a user’s movements. All of these require clever processing by the computer responsible for creating the illusion. 

Improvements in tracking what a user is doing also help. “Room scale” VR systems let people move around in the real world while perceiving similar movement in the virtual one. Following a user’s movement can be done in one of two ways. Outside-in tracking relies on external cameras observing beacons of various sorts scattered around a user’s body. Inside-out tracking is the opposite: the beacons are scattered around the room and detectors on a user’s body employ them as reference points. 

On top of all this, there is the design of the lenses that sit inside a headset in front of a user’s eyes to adjust optically for the fact that what is actually a nearby image is supposed to be some distance away. Since the shape of these lenses is fixed and the amount of adjustment required varies with what is being looked at, distortion is inevitable. But distortions are particularly noticeable when users move their eyes, says Paul MacNeilage of the University of Nevada, Reno. Some headsets therefore now track a user’s gaze and move the lenses within the headset in response. 

Make the input too credible, though, and you run into a different problem—the contrast between what a user’s eyes are seeing and what the motion-sensors in his inner ear are detecting. To deal with that, some designers program in a “virtual nose”, just visible to the user, to serve as a point of reference. 

These tactics help. But they do not get rid of cyber-sickness entirely. That is where the second hypothesis, unstable posture, comes in. And it is one that has the virtue of offering an explanation of a mystery about the condition—why women are more likely to be affected than men. 

Thomas Stoffregen of the University of Minnesota, who has studied the matter and found women four times as susceptible as men, cites the example of driving a car to explain the unstable-posture hypothesis. When turning the steering wheel, he observes, drivers need to keep their heads oriented to the road. They need to stabilise their bodies, particularly when the car is changing direction and pushing the body in different ways. “When you spend a lot of time in cars, you get used to doing that,” he says. “It’s a skill.” But in virtual environments, where there are no forces to act as signals, people have not learned to adjust their bodies properly. They lean when the virtual car turns, but in fact they are leaning away from stability. He finds this particularly affects women, who have lower centres of gravity than men. That may cause them to sway more. And increased swaying, he has found, correlates with higher rates of cyber-sickness. 

It is a neat idea. But Bas Rokers of the University of Wisconsin-Madison believes there is a simpler explanation for women’s experience of cyber-sickness, which is that headsets are not designed for them. For VR to work properly, sets need to be adjusted to the distance between the pupils of a user’s eyes. In one popular brand, however, Dr Rokers found that 90% of women have an interpupillary distance less than the default headset setting, and 27% of women’s eyes do not fit the headset at all. 

If Dr Rokers is correct, a big part of the problem of cyber-sickness might be dealt with by a small change to helmet design. If women’s rates of the complaint could be reduced to the level experienced by men, then a lot more people could enjoy VR rather than enduring it. And then, perhaps, it really might achieve its potential.

<h3 id="4.1">Business this week</h3>

Alibaba priced its forthcoming flotation on the Hong Kong stock exchange at HK$176 ($22.49) a share, which could see it raise up to $12.9bn if all the options are taken up. The Chinese e-commerce giant is already listed in New York. It had wanted to undertake a secondary listing in Hong Kong earlier this year, before the city plunged into political [`turmoil`]( "Turmoil is a state of confusion, disorder, uncertainty, or great anxiety. 混乱; 骚乱"). Taking no chances, Alibaba’s Hong Kong stock code will be 9988, numbers that symbolise enduring fortune in China. 

Scaling back its IPO, the indicative price at which Saudi Aramco is to sell shares on the Riyadh exchange valued it at up to $1.7trn. That is short of the $2trn that Muhammad bin Salman, Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler, had wanted. The state-owned oil firm could raise up to $25.6bn, below the $100bn it had once hoped for, but still pipping Alibaba’s record IPO, set in New York in 2014. Aramco is selling 1.5% of the company: 0.5% to retail investors in the kingdom and 1% to regional funds and institutions; it has scaled back plans to [`drum up`](   "If you drum up support or business, you try to get it. 竭力争取") investors outside the Gulf. The shares are expected to start trading in December. 

Under pressure to boost economic growth, China’s central bank cut its key interest rates, though by just 0.05 percentage points. The move is another signal of a shift at the People’s Bank of China towards a modest easing cycle. 

Australia’s financial-intelligence agency accused Westpac, the country’s second-largest bank, of failing to adequately monitor A$11bn ($7.5bn) in suspicious transactions, some of which were payments to child exploiters in South-East Asian countries. It is the country’s biggest-ever money-laundering scandal, which could result in huge fines for Westpac. 

HP rejected a takeover bid from Xerox, which proposed the offer earlier this month. But the maker of computers and printers left the door open to a potential combination of their businesses. 

America’s Commerce Department said it would issue licences to some companies that will allow them to supply goods and services to Huawei again. It had earlier granted another 90-day waiver for commercial sanctions it has placed on the Chinese maker of smartphones and network-equipment gear, enabling American firms to carry on supporting existing products they have sold to it. The sanctions have proved to be porous, with many firms finding ways through them. Huawei has so far shrugged off the effects. 

Amazon confirmed that it will appeal against the Pentagon’s decision to award a $10bn cloud-computing contract to Microsoft. Amazon had been favourite to win the contract, before Donald Trump, who has kept up a public feud with Jeff Bezos, the company’s boss, suggested it should go elsewhere. Amazon says that procurements should be administered “objectively” and “free from political influence”. Mark Esper, the defence secretary, said the process had been fair.  

After music, film and television, internet streaming came to gaming with the launch of Google’s Stadia platform. Users pay a subscription to access games in the cloud which can be played on any device with a strong Wi-Fi connection. Game streaming is unlikely to make consoles obsolete. Microsoft and Sony are bringing out new games consoles next year. Microsoft is also planning its own streaming service. See article. 

America’s National Transportation Safety Board found that an “inadequate safety culture” at Uber’s self-driving vehicle division had contributed to the death of a pedestrian in March 2018, the first time someone has been killed by an autonomous car. The proximate cause was the vehicle’s safety driver, who was distracted by her smartphone, glancing away from the road 23 times in the three minutes before the crash. The incident has pushed back the development of self-driving cars. 

General Motors filed a lawsuit against Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, accusing it of corrupting its negotiations with unions. The three executives at Fiat named in the suit have already pleaded guilty to charges in a lengthy federal investigation into their ties to the United Auto Workers. 

India’s three biggest wireless telecom firms said they would increase fees next month, ending a three-year price war that has given their customers the cheapest data packages in the world. Two of the companies need to raise cash in order to pay government fees following a court ruling. Their share prices surged after announcing the price rises. 

Investing in e-commerce and same-day delivery has paid off for Target, which reported another solid set of quarterly earnings. The retailer, which in 2017 struggled with a rapid decline in sales, has also revamped its stores. The turnaround has bolstered its share price, which has risen by 90% since the start of the year.

<h3 id="4.2">Politics this week</h3>

Sri Lanka’s presidential election was won by Gotabaya Rajapaksa, the younger brother of Mahinda Rajapaksa, a former president who oversaw the bloody end to an [`insurrection`](    "An insurrection is violent action that is taken by a large group of people against the rulers of their country, usually in order to remove them from office. 叛乱") by Tamil separatists. Gotabaya Rajapaksa was defence secretary during the fighting. His Sinhala-Buddhist nationalist campaign pledged to wipe out terrorism, following attacks at Easter by jihadists, in which 268 people died. The elder Mr Rajapaska will be prime minister. See article. 

Police shot rubber bullets at the protesters occupying Hong Kong Polytechnic University. Most of the students eventually left the campus. Meanwhile, a court in Hong Kong overturned a ban on wearing masks in the protests, finding it contravened the territory’s Basic Law. The decision was denounced by China’s National People’s Congress, which suggested that only it had the power to rule on constitutional issues in Hong Kong. See article. 

The American Congress passed the Hong Kong Freedom and Democracy bill, a largely symbolic act that will anger China and encourage the protesters. Donald Trump is expected to sign it. 

America walked out of talks in Seoul with South Korea in a dispute about paying for American troops stationed in the country. South Korean politicians say America wants $5bn a year, five times what it is getting now from the South Korean government. See article. 

The Taliban released two academics, one American and one Australian, whom it had held captive since 2016, in exchange for three militants. Afghanistan’s president, Ashraf Ghani, said the swap of hostages for prisoners was necessary to kick-start peace talks with the jihadists. 

Gordon Sondland, America’s ambassador to the EU and the star witness in the impeachment inquiry into Donald Trump, gave his public testimony to the House. Mr Sondland said he and others had followed orders from the president to put pressure on Ukraine to dig up dirt on Joe Biden and that the Ukrainians knew there would be a clear “quid pro quo” if they co-operated. He also said “everyone was in the loop”, including Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, and Mike Pence, the vice-president. See article. 

A jury found Roger Stone guilty on all charges related to `obstruction`<sup>阻碍</sup> of the Mueller investigation into Russian interference in American politics. Mr Stone is a Republican operative who earned his stripes on Richard Nixon’s campaign. He once claimed to have “launched the idea” of Mr Trump for president. 

Large protests erupted in Iran after the government increased the price of heavily subsidised fuel. Demonstrators blocked traffic, torched banks and burnt petrol stations. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader, called the protesters “thugs” and blamed foreign powers for the unrest. Dozens of people have been killed by the authorities, say human-rights groups. See article. 

Mike Pompeo, America’s secretary of state, announced that Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank are consistent with international law. Most of Israel’s other allies disagree. Past American administrations largely dodged the question. The decision will have no immediate effect on the ground, but it may embolden Israeli politicians who want to annex the settlements. Meanwhile, Benny Gantz missed the deadline to form a government in Israel, raising the possibility of another election, as Binyamin Netanyahu faced mounting legal woes. See article. 

Israel carried out air strikes in Syria, hitting targets belonging to the government and its Iranian allies. The attacks were in response to rockets fired at Israel by Iranian forces. 

Escalating conflicts in Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger have created a humanitarian crisis in which 2.4m people need urgent food aid, said the UN’s World Food Programme. The worst affected is Burkina Faso, where more than half a million people have fled their homes. 

The pace of deforestation of the Brazilian Amazon in the year to July reached its highest level in a decade, said the country’s space agency. It was nearly 30% faster than in the previous year. Environmentalists blame Brazil’s populist president, Jair Bolsonaro, who wants to open the region to miners and `ranchers`<sup>农场主</sup>. See article. 

Following a wave of political protests, Chile’s government agreed to hold a referendum in April on whether the country should write a new constitution. Chileans will be able to decide what sort of body should draft it and will also be able to vote on the final text of a constitution. See article. 

The death toll in the unrest leading up to and after Evo Morales’s resignation as Bolivia’s president rose to at least 32 people. Security forces fired on pro-Morales demonstrators who had blocked a fuel plant near the capital, La Paz. The protesters want the interim president, Jeanine Áñez, to resign. They also want new elections. A decree by the interim government appeared to encourage the police to be `overzealous`<sup>过分热心的</sup> in their efforts to quell protests. 

Britain’s two main party leaders clashed in the first televised election debate. The courts rejected demands from the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National Party that they should be included. Boris Johnson, the Conservative prime minister, did slightly better than Jeremy Corbyn, the far-left leader of the Labour Party. The Conservatives’ press office altered its Twitter account to look like a fact-checking service. See article. 

Prosecutors in Sweden formally ended an investigation into rape allegations made against Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, a website that publishes official secrets. Mr Assange remains in custody in London while a case for his extradition to America is considered. 

Parliamentary elections were held in Belarus, the former Soviet republic whose president, Alexander Lukashenko, has been in uncontested power for the past 25 years. The opposition won no seats at all.

<h3 id="5.1">China’s tech darlings have been on a tear</h3>

AMERICA’S TECHNOLOGY unicorns, as privately held startups worth $1bn or more are known, seem to lose their magic as soon as they go public. The market capitalisation of Uber is down by almost half since it listed in May. Lyft has shed a bit more even than its bigger ride-hailing rival. Neither is remotely profitable. Slack, a corporate-messaging service, lost $360m in its first quarter as a public company, over ten times more than as a private one a year earlier. Its share price has slid, too (see chart). 

China also has its own tech duds. Shares in Xiaomi, a maker of smartphones and gadgets, are worth half of their offering price last July. But other Chinese unicorns have managed to retain some of their mojo. 

Two in particular have been on a tear in the past six months: Meituan-Dianping, an online-services super-app that trades in Hong Kong, and Pinduoduo, a shopping app listed on New York’s Nasdaq exchange. With a market capitalisation of $72bn, Meituan is now China’s third-biggest listed internet firm, behind Alibaba and Tencent. Pinduoduo’s $36bn puts it fifth, behind Baidu.  

Meituan burned through cash to fuel its food-delivery and bike-rental businesses. Users were delighted; investors, less so. But the strategy appears to have paid off: the company reported its first net profit, of 876m yuan ($128m), in the second quarter. Sanford C. Bernstein, a research firm, reckons that Meituan may continue to make money, not least because its meal-toting rivals—including Alibaba—are losing their appetite to fork out much more. 

Pinduoduo, for its part, has overtaken JD.com as China’s second-largest e-commerce site by number of annual buyers (over 500m). It claims to be a combination of Costco (cheap) and Disneyland (thrills). Recruit friends to join you in ordering a crate of 30 kiwis, and their price falls. 

Pinduoduo boomed early on in underserved poor cities. But as it moves into richer ones it will come up against Alibaba, whose defences will be `bolstered`<sup>加固的</sup> by the up to $12.9bn it plans to raise in a secondary listing in Hong Kong on November 26th. On November 20th Pinduoduo reported a loss in the third quarter that was wider than expected. Its shares fell by 23%. No one said staying magical would be easy.

<h3 id="5.2">Donald Trump wants hospitals to be more upfront about prices</h3>

“I DON’T KNOW if the hospitals are going to like me too much any more with this,” quipped President Donald Trump on November 15th. He was referring to two bold initiatives unveiled earlier that day by Alex Azar, his health secretary, to rein in America’s soaring health-care costs. The administration finalised a rule, to take effect in 2021, which will double down on its effort to bring price transparency to hospital care. And it put forward a new proposal, open for 60 days of public comment, that would force health-insurance firms to reveal confidential details of negotiated discounts with hospitals and doctors. It is the biggest shake-up of America’s $3.5trn health-care industry in years. And no, hospital operators are not happy. 

Mr Trump’s first round of hospital reform required hospitals to make public the full list of costs billable to patients or their insurers. Hospitals previously held these so-called “chargemasters” close to their chest. Since January, when the reform came into force, they have taken to releasing [`convoluted`]( "f you describe a sentence, idea, or system as convoluted, you mean that it is complicated and difficult to understand. 晦涩的; 复杂的") spreadsheets with theoretical list prices for thousands of procedures, all couched in impenetrable medical jargon—transparent in theory but “useless” in practice, says George Nation of Lehigh University in Pennsylvania. 

The new rule goes further. It requires hospitals to disclose and update details, including gross charges, cash prices and negotiated rates, for thousands of services. They must also explain in plain English how much a basket of 300 common services (things like MRI scans or hip replacements) will cost, including any extras and hidden charges. 

In setting his sights on hospitals, Mr Trump is taking on a colossus. They accounted for nearly a third of America’s health-care costs in 2017, far more than the share of much-maligned drugmakers (see chart 1). The country has over 6,000 hospitals. Only 1,300 or so are private for-profit institutions; the rest are non-profit or government-run. The lack of an overt profit motive has done little to rein in prices, however. Hospital costs have risen at an annual rate of close to 5%, compared with below 1% for drug prices. Nor has a charitable mission dampened the ambition of bosses at big hospital chains; seven-figure salaries are not unheard of at those with revenues exceeding $500m a year. They have also been on an acquisition binge. The number of deals has jumped from around 55 a year between 2002 and 2009 to 90 or more these days. Since 2018 non-profit hospitals have been the acquirers in three-quarters of the transactions. 

Early on, consolidation was fuelled by the passage in 2010 of the Affordable Care Act. Barack Obama’s health reform imposed red tape, such as a switch to electronic medical records, that some smaller hospitals found onerous. Moody’s, a ratings agency, thinks economies of scale and gaining leverage in negotiations with insurers are now the chief motive. 

The merger wave has increased concentration and pricing power. Brent Fulton of the University of California, Berkeley, found that 90% of America’s hospital markets, representing a population of over 200m, were highly concentrated (see chart 2). Zack Cooper of Yale University, whose team looked at insurance claims covering over a quarter of Americans with employer-provided health insurance, discovered that prices at hospitals with a local monopoly were 12% higher than in markets with four or more rivals. A study by an insurance-industry body concluded that consolidation cut costs by 15-30% at acquired hospitals, but average prices for hospital services still rose by between 6% and 18%. 

According to the American Hospital Association, a lobby group, operating margins in the industry rose from 4.4% in 2007 to 6.4% in 2017. But many hospitals in rural areas, which suffer from undercapacity, and in poor urban areas, which have lots of uninsured patients, barely break even or lose money. Big for-profit chains like HCA Healthcare, with around 180 hospitals, can enjoy high (if volatile) margins. Non-profit institutions often plough those gains into expansion or salaries. 

Given this concentration, many experts are sceptical that transparency alone can rein in prices. Sherry Gleid of New York University observes that patients are often not price-sensitive. They are either in need of urgent care, with no time to shop around, or have insurance, and so pay a fraction of the full cost (often nothing beyond an annual `out-of-pocket`<sup>赔钱</sup> limit). 

Insurers, for their part, care less about prices because they now make more money by managing health plans for self-insured employers than by managing risk. They may even like to see inflation rise, since they can take a bigger cut from a bigger base. A well-intentioned Obamacare rule forces insurers to pay out at least 80% of their revenue from premiums. But by capping margins, it encourages raising revenue, not efficiency—and higher costs can be used to justify higher premiums. 

Others are more hopeful. Marty Makary of Johns Hopkins University, author of “The Price We Pay”, a new book about America’s health-care system, thinks that a small number of “proxy shoppers” can bring about powerful change once prices are revealed, even if most patients remain insensitive to prices. Dr Makary points out that in elective procedures like LASIK eye surgery, cosmetic surgery or in vitro fertilisation, which enjoy full transparency, “prices fall and quality rises each year just like in every normal market.” 

It is possible that prices may initially rise in some places as cheaper hospitals raise theirs once they realise how much peers in similar markets or pricier local rivals are earning. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has raised that troubling prospect—and hospitals have (self-servingly) echoed it. Hospital lobbyists report their clients are likely to sue the government over the new rules. 

Larry Levitt of the Kaiser Family Foundation, a health-care think-tank, worries that many hospitals will ignore the paltry $300 daily penalty for [`scofflaws`](    "]If you refer to someone as a scofflaw, you mean that they refuse to obey the law, for example, by failing to pay their debts or by ignoring minor legal regulations. 常违反法规者") as a cost of doing business. But, he says, Mr Azar’s second proposal, to force disclosure of prices insurers actually pay, may prove [`potent`](  "Something that is potent is very effective and powerful"). 

The cost of insurance is growing unbearable for many. Nearly 180m Americans, more than half the population, are covered by employer-provided health insurance. The average family’s premiums have shot up by 54% over the past decade, far outpacing wage growth, and employers are shifting more costs onto workers through ever higher out-of-pocket payments and deductibles. Reformers hope that by making real prices and out-of-pocket costs available upfront in simple language, patients can shop for non-emergency services. PwC, a consultancy, reckons these make up about half of all medical services by volume (though less by value). 

Why should hospital and insurance prices remain taboo, asks Dr Makary, when a corner of the health industry is already subject to strict transparency regulation? The Funeral Rule, enacted by the FTC in 1985, requires undertakers to provide itemised and detailed price data. What is good for the dead is surely good for the living.

<h3 id="5.3">Google launches its game-streaming platform</h3>

THE LAUNCH in 2018 of “Red Dead Redemption 2” was a huge event in the history of entertainment. It raked in $725m in its first three days, behind only “Avengers: Endgame”, a recent superhero flick, and “Grand Theft Auto V”, a game from 2013—and that despite being available only to owners of pricey games consoles. On November 19th it became available to an even wider audience with the launch of Stadia, Google’s game-streaming service. 

Google is not the only tech titan to bet that streaming will prove as transformative for the $150bn video-game industry as it has been for music, film and television. This month Microsoft announced new games for its experimental xCloud service, which is due to launch in 2020. It will work with Xbox Game Pass, an existing download-based subscription service that offers more than 100 titles. Amazon is widely assumed to be working on something similar. Big Tech will be battling second-tier players, including Nvidia, a maker of gaming-focused computer chips, and Electronic Arts (EA), a games publisher. Sony, which makes consoles, already offers streaming through its PlayStation Now service. 

Streaming lets anyone with an internet connection play any game by farming out the computational heavy lifting required to run gaming software to cloud servers. It will not replace consoles overnight; both Microsoft and Sony are launching new machines next year. But by offering the option to play blockbuster games like “Red Dead Redemption 2” without paying upfront for hardware, it could lure owners of comparatively feeble devices such as smartphones, tablets and TVs to cutting-edge games. 

Catherine Gluckstein, one of the Microsoft executives in charge of xCloud, points out that of the 5bn people who own smartphones, about half [`dabble`](    "If you dabble in something, you take part in it but not very seriously. 涉猎") in cheap-and-cheerful mobile games. Next year xCloud tests will be expanded to India, where consoles remain a luxury but internet no longer is; more than 500m Indians enjoy access to the web, mostly on their phones. Michael Pachter of Wedbush, an investment firm, thinks streaming’s worldwide expansion could triple the size of the gaming market to nearly $500bn by 2030. 

 

If, that is, the companies can pull it off. Streaming a film or a song is straightforward. Data can be downloaded ahead of time to smooth out connection hiccups. Not for games, which must react instantaneously to players’ moves and vice versa. Even with a rock-solid connection (which most mobile ones are not) commands take time to travel from the controller to the data centre and back. This can introduce annoying delays. And distributing games the old way, via physical disks or downloads, is cheap, whereas providing high-end, game-capable computing in the cloud is not, notes Piers Harding-Rolls, an analyst at IHS Markit, a research firm. A decade ago early attempts at game streaming flopped precisely because of high prices and `iffy`<sup>未确定的，不太好的</sup> technology. 

All eyes are now on Google. Like Amazon and Microsoft, it owns a worldwide network of cloud-computing data centres, which could help surmount technological niggles. But unlike Microsoft or Sony, it lacks deep roots in gaming. And in contrast to Amazon, whose 100m Prime subscribers could, Mr Patcher thinks, be offered games as part of their membership, it must build a customer base from scratch. 

Stadia’s debut could have gone better. Promised features have been delayed. Prices remain high: early adopters must pay $129 for a controller and $10 a month for a subscription, and then fork out some more for individual games. (A subscription-free option, with less fancy graphics, will launch in 2020.) 

Most worrying, Google has struggled to convince publishers to sign up. Just 22 games were available at Stadia’s launch. The test version of Microsoft’s xCloud features over 50. Sony’s PlayStation Now has over 650 games (although some are over a decade old and the service is available only on PCs and the PlayStation). For all its heft elsewhere, in gaming Google continues to look like a bit player.

<h3 id="5.4">Nationalising BT may not improve Britain’s broadband</h3>


IN 1990 BRITISH TELECOM (BT), a former state-owned monopoly, was in the early stages of upgrading its copper wires to fibre-optic cables. Its plans were [`scotched`](  "If you scotch a rumour, plan, or idea, you put an end to it before it can develop any further. 结束; 制止") by the Conservative government of the day, worried that it would damage the competitiveness of other firms in Britain’s newly liberalised telecoms markets. Three decades on, broadband is once again a hot-button election issue. The opposition Labour Party wants parts of BT to be renationalised—and a full fibre-optic upgrade to be completed. British Broadband, as the new entity would be called, could then offer free connectivity to every citizen and firm. 

Labour thinks state control could lift Britain in global fibre-optic rankings. The OECD, a rich-country club, puts it 35th out of 37 countries in its use of the technology, which allows far higher speeds than copper wires (see chart 1). The government has already pencilled in £5bn ($6.5bn) to raise fibre’s share of broadband. 

On top of nationalisation, Labour wants to boost this pot to £20bn and to maintain the new network via a tax on technology firms that `furnish`<sup>提供</sup> services over it. Nationalised industries are not always inefficient, Labour says. Jeremy Corbyn, its leader, has compared the project to the National Health Service, which achieves passable results while spending less per person than most other rich-country health systems. 

It is true that some of the speediest nations have been more willing to spend and to prod private firms than Britain has, which for decades has relied on opening up BT’s core network so that other firms can `piggyback off`<sup>借助</sup> it as the main mechanism to improve standards. But wiring up a rich microstate like Singapore or San Marino is a doddle compared with doing the same in sparsely populated Scotland. So is `hooking up`<sup>连结</sup> flats, which are more popular in continental Europe than in Britain. 

Perhaps the closest comparison would be with Australia’s state-run National Broadband Network, which also promises a high-speed connection to every home (though consumers must still pay private internet-service providers to connect to it). It is late and its costs have risen from A$30bn in 2013 (then $29bn, and 1.9% of GDP) to A$51bn today, which is 2.6% of GDP. Critics call it a wasteful mess. Even defenders say it has become a political football. 

British broadband is not quite as awful as the fibre figures imply (see chart 2). Different comparisons of broadband speeds give different results, though most put Britain behind other rich countries. On the other hand, prices are reasonable. And though ultra-fast connections are rare by international standards, so are truly [`sluggish`](    "You can describe something as sluggish if it moves, works, or reacts much slower than you would like or is normal. 缓慢的; 迟钝的") ones. Such digital equality should please the [`egalitarian`]( "Egalitarian means supporting or following the idea that all people are equal and should have the same rights and opportunities. 平等主义的") Mr Corbyn.

<h3 id="5.5">Refugees make great entrepreneurs and workers</h3>

MOHAMMED RAHIMEH left Damascus in December 2015, rather than be conscripted into the Syrian army. His journey to London took him through Lebanon and Greece and included 11 months in the [`notorious`](    "To be notorious means to be well known for something bad. 声名狼藉的") “Jungle” camp in Calais. Despite leaving Syria with no cooking qualifications or English skills, he is now in the process of setting up a food business in Britain. 

History is `replete`<sup>充满的</sup> with immigrants who have brought economic skills with them, from the Flemish weavers who came to England in the 14th century to the millions of Europeans who emigrated to America in the late 19th. Today’s migrants also have plenty to offer, if only the authorities will let them work. 

While he was waiting for his asylum claim to be processed in Britain, Mr Rahimeh wasn’t allowed to take a job. But he did develop his cooking skills, focusing on a recipe involving eggs, onions, tomatoes and spices. With the help of Alexandra Simmons, a volunteer he had met in Calais, he set up Mo’s Eggs, a business that offered a Syrian brunch. He was able to take advantage of a trend for pop-up restaurants, venues that only exist for a day every week or month. 

The first site was a pizza restaurant in Archway, in north London, and his first event was Ms Simmons’s 30th birthday party. He served around 60 people every month until the venue closed, but will soon open a new place in Tooting Broadway, in the south of the city. In the interim, he has been working at a market stall to learn more about the food trade. 

This is what immigrants tend to do; they work hard so they can rebuild their lives and they spot niches in the market that others might miss. A similar path was followed by Majeda Khoury, a human-rights activist who made her way from Damascus to Britain. She learned to cook thanks to a charity called Migrateful and prepares food associated with different Syrian cities; a favourite dish in Damascus, harak osbao, features lentils and pasta with tamarind, coriander, garlic and pomegranate molasses. Now she runs catering at big events for charities that want to focus on Syria. 

Both Ms Khoury and Mr Rahimeh benefited from sales and marketing training by the Enterpreneurial Refugee Network (TERN), a charity. Charlie Fraser, TERN’s co-founder, says the aim is to launch 1,000 refugee-led businesses in Britain by 2025. 

It is very hard for refugees to start a business when they cannot leave the camps in the first place. Paul Hutchings is trying to help those people who are stuck. He used to be a market researcher, before going to Calais to help refugees in 2008. In 2016 he set up Refugee Support, another charity, which has been involved in camps in Bangladesh, Cyprus, Greece and Mexico. 

The model is to promote `dignity`<sup>尊严</sup> rather than dependence; instead of just handing out food and clothes, the charity set up a shop. It created tokens so residents could buy their own things. Dina Nayeri, a former refugee, says this is very important; at one camp she attended, people had to search through piles of old clothes that were dumped on the floor. Ms Nayeri says that many refugees struggle with trauma, feelings of shame and inferiority and the expectations of other people that they should always be grateful. After she made it to America, Ms Nayeri became a writer, publishing two novels and a non-fiction book, “The Ungrateful Refugee”. 

Dignity also requires that refugees find work. If they stay in the camps, they qualify for grants from the EU but the risk, Mr Hutchings says, is that they become institutionalised. At first, Refugee Support tried to give microloans to let people set up small businesses. But this ran into a regulatory brick wall. 

So instead, Mr Hutchings rented a building, now called the Dignity Centre, where people can learn skills. One of the projects is a sewing co-operative which has 18 machines, where refugees make bags, cushion covers and aprons. The charity provides the material, machines and electricity and sells the goods online at Refumade.org; each item comes with a message about the person who made it. The sewing workers are mostly women. For the men, the charity has set up a bicycle-sharing scheme in Cyprus to help them find work away from the camps. 

The refugees Bartleby spoke to had undergone an immense struggle to reach their current position. Their determination to make something of their lives was truly striking. That is the kind of work ethic any company, and any country, ought to value.

<h3 id="5.6">Rethinking McKinsey</h3>

WHEN BUSINESSMEN talk to partners of McKinsey, the high priests of management consultancy, it is like Catholics going to confession. They reveal all. They expect confidentiality. And whether or not it changes behaviour, the act itself is good for the soul. In this era of corporate unease, over everything from the next recession to climate change, executives are lining up at the confessional. But McKinsey, too, has some soul-searching to do. Its industry, estimated to be worth $300bn, is, like those of its clients, being transformed. And as its most revered—and hermetic—standard bearer, it is under more [`scrutiny`]( "If a person or thing is under scrutiny, they are being studied or observed very carefully. 仔细研究; 仔细观察") than ever before. 

Kevin Sneader, who took over as global managing partner last year, has lots on his plate. Recent years have been uncomfortable. Until a decade ago no McKinseyite had ever been sued for securities-law violations. In 2012 its former managing partner, Rajat Gupta, was convicted of insider-trading committed after he left the firm. Then in 2016 McKinsey was embroiled in a scandal in South Africa after it worked with Trillian, a local consulting firm owned by an associate of the controversial Gupta family (no relation to Mr Gupta). Mr Sneader has repeatedly apologised. 

More recently it has faced allegations that its work on behalf of companies in bankruptcy in America represents a conflict of interest, because its $12.7bn investment affiliate, McKinsey Investment Office (MIO), may invest in securities related to the bankruptcies. It denies the allegations, saying that MIO is a separate entity whose investments are controlled almost entirely by outside investment managers. Jay Alix, the founder of AlixPartners, a veteran of the bankruptcy business, has sought to drag McKinsey through the courts. He claims that its alleged lack of disclosure should preclude it from working on bankruptcies. Judges have so far dismissed four out of five cases on the grounds that Mr Alix lacked standing to pursue them in the first place. In August a federal judge threw out another charge from Mr Alix that McKinsey had violated racketeering laws. In one remaining case involving the bankruptcy of Westmoreland Coal, a judge in Texas has set a trial date in February to rule on the dispute. 

McKinsey says Mr Alix is engaged in a [`vendetta`]( "If one person has a vendetta against another, the first person wants revenge for something the second person did to them in the past. 宿怨") that aims to stifle competition. Mr Alix, whose litigious investment firm, Mar-Bow Value Partners, is mischievously named after Marvin Bower, one of McKinsey’s founding fathers, claims to be fighting to defend the integrity of the bankruptcy system. But the saga is a regrettable one for McKinsey, even if it is fully vindicated. The bankruptcy business is not lucrative. McKinsey says it gets involved in bankruptcies only because its clients ask it to. It has worked on barely 15 cases since it started its restructurings practice in 2001. But it is understandably loth to be strong-armed out of the business by Mr Alix. That has made this an unusually public feud for a company that stands out for its discretion. 

It is possible to think of these controversies as one-offs. McKinsey may win the remaining bankruptcy judgments. The two scandals can be explained as the work of rogue operators. But they speak to bigger questions about the firm’s scope and mission, which Mr Sneader must grapple with. McKinsey has grown fast. Partners now number 2,200, up from 1,250 about a decade ago and it employs 30,000 people worldwide, up from 17,000 in 2009. Many of these are different from the buttoned-down business graduates of yesteryear. It has diversified into new business lines and some of its most valuable work is now outside America. As the firm has got bigger and more complex, it has got harder to manage. 

Complicating things further, management consultancy itself is changing, too. Six years ago, Clayton Christensen of Harvard Business School warned that it was an industry “on the cusp of disruption”. Now that disruption is in full swing. According to Tom Rodenhauser of ALM Intelligence, which analyses the industry, clients no longer just want to hire legions of people, however brainy they are. They want consultants to provide and install products, including new technologies, that transform them from top to bottom and keep disrupters at bay. Advice on strategy, which used to be meat and [`potatoes`](   "You can refer to a difficult subject that people disagree on as a hot potato. 烫手山芋") for firms like McKinsey and its peers, Bain and the Boston Consulting Group (BCG), is now a side dish; it accounts for about a tenth of revenues. 

Mr Sneader could keep things ticking over as they are, at least for a while. Clients have shrugged off the media attention. McKinsey’s revenue has grown in recent years, to roughly $10bn. And the firm still attracts armies of aspiring candidates—last year 800,000 applied for 8,000 jobs. But he is making changes. McKinsey says it is “addressing the changing panorama both internally and externally”. Partly in response to the South Africa debacle, its standards and processes for selecting clients have been beefed up. Partners are discouraged from doing work for undemocratic governments. 

McKinsey has also made advising on technology more integral to its business. It worked with 1,200 companies on digital and analytics issues last year. It creates and sells tools for companies to use in their businesses, which generates new sources of recurring revenues. And it has bought a dozen companies since 2011, including QuantumBlack, a British startup that developed advanced data analytics for Formula One. Nonetheless, industry-watchers say McKinsey is often `outspent`<sup>筋疲力尽的</sup> by the technology offerings of the Big Four, as well as by firms like Accenture. 

Mr Sneader should go further: that means getting leaner by ditching activities, clients and teams that bring in more headaches than cash, and investing in technology. It is here that McKinsey may have a secret weapon—its partnership, honed over 93 years. It is not a listed firm, so faces less pressure to raise short-term profits. And, with luck, the priesthood has not yet become so sprawling that it has lost a sense of its values. Whisper it in the confession box: McKinsey needs to shrink its way to further greatness.

<h3 id="5.7">RWE wants to clean up its act</h3>

FOR 120 years RWE has been one of Europe’s biggest emitters of carbon dioxide. The German utility cleared almost all of Hambacher forest, a once-vast wood in western Germany, to mine lignite, an especially `filthy`<sup>脏的</sup> fossil fuel, which it burned to generate electricity. What is left of “Hambi” has become a symbol of the anti-coal movement, occupied by activists camping in 80-odd tree houses. Greta Thunberg, a star teenage carbon critic, paid them a visit in August. RWE is under fire even where it does not operate. A Peruvian farmer has sued it in a German court for its contribution to climate change that led to the melting of an Andean glacier, which threatens to flood his home. He lost but is appealing. 

RWE’s ongoing battle with environmentalists, who have pelted its workers with stones and excrement, may soon be over. Or so hopes its boss, Rolf Martin Schmitz. In September the EU agreed to a €43bn ($47.5bn) asset swap between RWE and its rival E.ON. It turns E.ON into Europe’s largest power-grid operator by assets and RWE into the world’s second-biggest producer of offshore wind power and Europe’s third-biggest producer of renewable energy. Since then Mr Schmitz has promoted “the new RWE”. A glossy brochure proclaims a vow to become carbon neutral by 2040. 

Sam Arie at UBS, a Swiss bank, sees promise in RWE Renewables, which rakes in gross operating profits of €1.5bn or so. Of the EU’s 28 members, 18 have pledged to emit no net carbon by 2050. Germany says it will stop using coal by 2038 and stump up €40bn to ease the transition. This should increase demand for renewables. But these same policies—and German politics—are creating uncertainty for RWE, says Mr Arie. 

RWE is demanding a chunk of the transition pot. It still runs three lignite mines, which directly employ 9,900 people and indirectly support another 20,000 jobs in the Rhine region. Mr Schmitz assumes most of the three gigawatts the government plans to phase out by 2023 will come from these mines. It may cost €1.2bn-1.5bn for every gigawatt—much less, he says, than the €28bn Germany spends each year on renewable-energy subsidies. In order to make his case, he shuttles several times a week from RWE’s headquarters in Essen to Berlin for talks with ministers. 

Resolving the `standoff`<sup>僵局</sup> at “Hambi” could be especially expensive. Last October a court ordered a halt to the clearing of its remaining 200 hectares (a thirtieth of its original extent). Mr Schmitz says the forest could be left as it is—but at a price. It may cost the company €1.5bn or so to find an alternative to a planned expansion of an open-pit mine at Hambach. 

Investors have remained bullish on RWE, whose share price is up by a third this year. But Mr Schmitz is not quite out of the woods. This month RWE’S profit forecast for the renewables business undershot analysts’ estimates. Much hinges on those frequent trips to Berlin. Insiders describe the tone of the discussions as ruppig (gruff) at times. RWE says agreement is “not yet imminent”. It is hoping for one by the end of the year. With winter upon them, Hambach’s tree-huggers must be, too.

<h3 id="6.1">Obituary: Terry O’Neill died on November 16th</h3>

WHEN BRIGITTE BARDOT was on the set of “The Legend of Frenchie King”, with a crowd of photographers snapping her, Terry O’Neill was waiting. Not, like the others, for the moment she would turn her gorgeous self towards them and strike a `stunning`<sup>极美的</sup> pose with her leather trousers and cigar. Instead he was praying for the wind to blow her long hair over her face, just once more. When it did, he had that frame. He called it his picture in a million. 

Over a career of 60 years, from hustling cub reportage for the Daily Sketch to gentle portraits of Nelson Mandela at 90, he always had an idea for how to get to the character, and usually, with a dose of luck, it worked. He encouraged Michael Caine to cradle rifles, framed Mick Jagger in a frosty fur hood, turned Dustin Hofmann into a pleading panhandler, and shot Elton John in his sequinned get-up against a huge audience that also sparkled. He let David Bowie, his crazily unpredictable favourite subject, bring in a Great Dane for the album-cover shoot of “Diamond Dogs”; the dog reared up and howled when the strobe went off, while Bowie, zoned out as usual, stayed still, weird and perfect. He convinced Faye Dunaway that if she won an Oscar in 1977 she should bring it to the Beverley Hills Hotel and pose beside the pool in her peach satin robe, with her Oscar on the breakfast table and newspapers scattered round her. His idea was to capture the morning after, when stardom had descended whether she wanted it or not. The shot became an image of [`jaded`](    "If you are jaded, you feel bored, tired, and not enthusiastic, because you have had too much of the same thing. 厌倦的") celebrity that thousands of people saw. 

Stars had been his subject since 1962, when he was sent to photograph a new band at the Abbey Road Studios. The older blokes at the Sketch scorned that kind of work, but the young were clearly on the rise, and he was by far the youngest photographer in Fleet Street at the time. At the studios, to get a better light, he took the group outside to snap them holding their guitars a bit defensively: John, Paul, George and Ringo. Next day’s Sketch was sold out, and he suddenly found himself with the run of London and all the coming bands, free to be as creative as he liked. A working-class kid from Romford whose prospects had been either the priesthood or a job in the Dagenham car plant, like his dad, had the world at his feet. He wouldn’t have had a prayer, he thought, in any other era. 

And obviously it couldn’t last. In a couple of years he would find a proper job, as both the Beatles and the Stones told him they were going to. For it was hardly serious work to point your Leica at someone and go snap, snap. It was only when he went to Hollywood in the mid-1960s, to shoot on movie sets, that he realised how definitively things had changed. The vast new market for album covers, pop magazines, film posters and colour supplements could keep him in work, and in the money, for life. He began to hang on to his pictures then, as he went on to do freelance for Vogue and Rolling Stone and Rave and the Sunday Times, until eventually his archive had 400m negatives in it. There would have been far more if, by the 2000s, modern celebrities hadn’t ceased to interest him. Amy Winehouse was the last one he wanted to photograph. 

What didn’t change was the nature of the work: catching that moment, being ready. He had scarcely graduated from a Box Brownie in 1959, totally self-taught, when he was sent to the Heathrow VIP lounge to photograph people arriving and departing. He snapped a gent in a `bowler`<sup>圆顶礼帽</sup> hat and suit asleep on a bench with African chieftains in full regalia round him, and it turned out to be the home secretary: a famous man suddenly unguarded. 

That picture earned him 25 quid. More to the point, it suggested a good way of approaching the stars. He would look for their human, vulnerable side, set things up, unobtrusively if he had to (his presence, like his voice, was always soft), and then start shooting. As he did, a dove settled by the bare white shoulder of Audrey Hepburn. Paul McCartney, playing the piano in a bar, suddenly raised his eyes to heaven as if amazed by the sound. Steve McQueen let his features relax as he took a phone call from a friend. Stars lounged and drowsed: Muhammad Ali with a newspaper, Peter Cook in his old mac on a lilo in a Hollywood pool. Best of all was to be allowed to tag along with a star for days, a fly on the wall, until they forgot that a photographer was there. He got such access with Frank Sinatra, who simply told his mafiosi minders, “The kid’s with me,” and whom he snapped strolling on the boardwalk in Miami Beach, still with his guard up but with all his swagger plain. 

It was easy enough for him to blend in as he worked, for he was short, good-looking and carefully cheeky. His Romford accent thrilled grouchy Lee Marvin, and his horse-racing jokes disarmed the queen into a smile of genuine happiness. Women regularly fell for his china-blue eyes, and he ended up in bed with many of them, including Ava Gardner, the most beautiful woman he ever saw, and Ms Dunaway, to whom he was married for a while. He would probably have bedded Marilyn Monroe, too, since she slept with all her photographers, but he never got the chance. Perhaps that was as well, for when he was with Faye he hated the whole circus. The last thing he wanted was to become a star himself. He was happy just eating fish and chips, listening to jazz, and taking pictures. 

At heart he was ever the `industrious`<sup>勤奋的</sup> Essex lad, working every day of the week. He didn’t like holidays. He also `loathed`<sup>讨厌</sup> digital photography, which was junk and a joke, and any sort of touching-up, which made him feel sullied. To the end, he clung to film cameras and to black-and-white as the best there was. Even so, there was always something about the finished print that dissatisfied him. If he had only stayed longer on that day, at that shoot, if he had just…he might have got something better. The wind might have blown a little bit closer to the idea he had in his head.

<h3 id="７.1">A saga of chocolate and upheaval in the Caucasus</h3>

The Eighth Life (For Brilka). By Nino Haratischvili. Translated by Charlotte Collins and Ruth Martin.Scribe; 944 pages; £20. To be published in America in April; $40. 

NINO HARATISCHVILI’S elegant epic recounts the fortunes of a Georgian family and the turbulent history of their country, from the beginning of the 20th century to the 2000s, through revolution, the fall of empires and world wars. It is a `triumph`<sup>胜利</sup> of both authorship and painstaking translation (from the original German) by Charlotte Collins and Ruth Martin. Each of the seven sections focuses on one life, the saga stretching from link to fascinating link as if they were jewels on a charm bracelet. 

In the prologue Niza Jashi, a disaffected 32-year-old professor who has left Georgia for Berlin to escape her family’s terrible history, is suddenly forced to reckon with it. Brilka, her 12-year-old niece, has absconded from a dance troupe touring Amsterdam; her mother, Niza’s older sister Daria, is dead. Dedicating the narrative to the girl, Niza enjoins her to transcend their clan’s misfortune. In the book’s chain of stories, Brilka’s will be the “eighth life”—“because they say the number eight represents infinity…I am giving my eight to you.” 

The chapters that follow place Ms Haratischvili’s characters at the centre of the “red century”, combining magical realism with the more [`prosaic`](   "Something that is prosaic is dull and uninteresting. 枯燥乏味的"), social kind. Niza and Brilka are descendants of what once seemed set to be a dynasty of chocolatiers. Niza’s great-great grandfather had trained in patisserie-making all over Europe; back in Tbilisi he created mouthwatering confections and built a successful business. His most [`coveted`](  "You use coveted to describe something that very many people would like to have. 令人垂涎的") recipe was for a chocolate [`elixir`](    "An elixir is a liquid that is considered to have magical powers. 灵丹妙药"), the exact ingredients of which he guarded, fearing its dangerously addictive effects—a metaphor, in the novel, for the allure of extreme ideologies. 

The first biography related by Niza is that of Stasia, the patriarch’s middle daughter, a spirited young woman who yearns to train as a ballet dancer in Paris. Instead, in 1917 she marries a lieutenant in Russia’s White Guard, suffering isolation and disillusionment when she travels to Petrograd to find him. Crucially, her father has trusted only her with the secret chocolate recipe. 

Her tale is followed by those of her spoilt half-sister Christine, Stasia’s son Kostya and daughter Kitty, a singer, Kostya’s daughter Elene, and Elene’s daughters, Daria and Niza themselves. Ms Haratischvili’s writing is lyrical, but she does not [`gloss over`]( "If you gloss over a problem, a mistake, or an embarrassing moment, you try to make it seem unimportant by ignoring it or by dealing with it very quickly. 无视; 草草了事") the compromises people make to survive. Above all, “The Eighth Life” is an unforgettable love letter to Georgia and the Caucasus, to lives led and to come, and to writing itself, a frontier where, Niza says, “legend ends and facts begin”.

<h3 id="７.2">Carmen Machado’s alternative memoir of abuse</h3>

In the Dream House. By Carmen Maria Machado.Graywolf Press; 272 pages; $26. To be published in Britain by Serpent’s Tail in January; £14.99. 

CARMEN MACHADO burst onto the American literary scene in 2017 with “Her Body and Other Parties”, a [`surreal`]( "If you describe something as surreal, you mean that the elements in it are combined in a strange way that you would not normally expect, like in a dream. 离奇的") and raunchy collection of stories. Two years later comes an unorthodox memoir that recounts her emotional abuse by a girlfriend over several years. But “In the Dream House” is also a hall of mirrors, “a book about a house that was not a house and a dream that was no dream at all”. 

As a student in the writing programme at the University of Iowa, Ms Machado fell in love with a woman whose reservoirs of cruelty made her “ill with fear”. The experience cleft her in two, she writes, and her memoir is duly divided into two points of view: the “I” of her recollections and the “you” of the powerless, captive—and captivated—victim of domestic abuse. 

The book is composed of scores of short sections, like shards, in which Ms Machado deploys every literary trick and `trope`<sup>比喻</sup> in the canon. Some examine her trauma using these devices (the Unreliable Narrator, the Bildungsroman); others employ themes from folklore; still others are comprised of philosophical propositions and analytical essays. Now at the University of Pennsylvania, Ms Machado is a scholar of narrative structure, and students of literature will find this approach provocative and rich; others may consider it too clever by half. Throughout, though, her writing is bracing, as full of humour and `whimsy`<sup>怪念头</sup>, sex and `creepiness`<sup>毛骨悚然</sup> as in her `offbeat`<sup>离奇的</sup> stories. 

She seems intent on smashing boundaries between genres, and between reality and imagination. Footnotes show how pervasive violent abuse has been through all times and tales. She offers trenchant commentary on the legend of Bluebeard and an episode of “Star Trek”. Later, she powerfully re-stages the airless trap of the abusive relationship, in which no answer placates a controlling partner, by creating a “Choose Your Own Adventure” that circles and circles on itself. Her lover delivers a steady torrent of hate and `denigration`<sup>诋毁</sup>, followed by denials that it has occurred at all, an escalating form of gaslighting from which Ms Machado cannot tear herself away. 

Presenting personal pain as a thriller might seem exploitative. Yet her story is inherently filled with suspense. As in a horror film, the reader is pulled onward to find out how the heroine will escape. The eventual denouement comes with a tricksy, if somewhat superficial, “Surprise Ending” and a “Plot Twist”. How exactly did she manage to put this experience behind her? The question is only partly answered in a vignette entitled “Dream House as Schrödinger’s Cat”, in which Ms Machado slyly tosses out many possible reasons for her choices, which may or may not be relevant. 

Perhaps most important, her book is a bid to break the silence surrounding abuse in the queer community. In any marginalised group there is a fear of airing dirty linen, she notes. “The desire to save face, to present a narrative of uniform morality, can defeat every other interest.” Yet anyone can be an abuser; women sometimes harm women. She imagines telling younger lesbians this truth: “The world is full of hurt people who hurt people.” As her folkloric references suggest, the cycle of abuse is a kind of poisonous enchantment in which victims can be enthralled. Ms Machado’s memoir casts a powerful counter-spell.

<h3 id="７.3">Making sculpture out of bullets in Kinshasa</h3>

“FOR ME, KINSHASA is a beautiful woman who walks barefoot,” says Freddy Tsimba, a sculptor, in his studio in Matongé, one of the city’s most chaotic districts. The capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is home to some 12m people. Battered cars choke its highways; its unpaved backstreets are [`clogged`](    "When something clogs a hole or place, it blocks it so that nothing can pass through. 堵塞") with stinking black mud. Once known as “Kin la belle”, its residents—fed up with the festering rubbish and open gutters—re-christened the place “Kin la poubelle”, or “Kin the dustbin”. But the barefoot woman also has charm. She dances to the fuzzy rumba beats that blast out of almost every bar; her noisy [`thoroughfares`](   "A thoroughfare is a main road in a city or town which usually has stores along it and a lot of traffic. 大道; 主要大街; 通衢") are full of hopeful, chattering people. Mr Tsimba gets some of his best ideas from watching them. 

“The streets are like a school to me and they’re always changing,” he says, now sipping a beer at his favourite roadside bar while sketching with a Biro. Passing street-hawkers pause at the tables to offer everything from fried plantain to cigarettes, chewing gum, roasted caterpillars and plywood chess boards. In the narrow road, motorbikes swerve round groups of gossiping schoolchildren and women carrying bowls of bananas on their heads. 

Yet as well as responding to the city, Mr Tsimba also wants the city to respond to his art. In 2014 he took a house he had built from 999 machetes to one of Kinshasa’s busiest markets. He stood silently beside it and listened as people argued about what it meant. “The reaction was intense,” he says. “People here are still traumatised by the Kulunas,” a group of machete-wielding youths who rob and kill. Eventually, Mr Tsimba told the crowd he wanted to show that the machete was not just an instrument of death. It was invented for farmers to cut weeds and crops. It could become whatever you made of it—even a house. 

Turning old materials—often those associated with death—into sculpture is Mr Tsimba’s speciality. He has built pieces from bullet casings, mousetraps, keys, mobile phones and bottle tops. Last year he sold a sculpture of a man with outstretched arms at Bonhams, an auction house in London, for £12,500 ($16,150). It was almost three metres tall and made entirely from spoons. Art collectors in the DRC “talk about Freddy as a real game-changer,” says Eliza Sawyer, a specialist in African contemporary art at Bonhams. “He’s on the cards for the next Venice Biennale.” 

Much of Mr Tsimba’s work has a message of revival. Transmuting bullets into art shows that new life can emerge from destruction. In the same way, he hopes Congo itself will be able to regenerate after its bitter, bloody past. Militias have terrorised its eastern provinces for over two decades; in the war that lasted from 1998 to 2003 between 1m and 5m people were killed. In 1997, during an earlier war, rebels marched on Kinshasa in old gumboots; child soldiers shot Kalashnikovs at fleeing government troops and took the capital. Mr Tsimba turned up in a city along their route to collect material for his sculptures. 

“I started picking up bullets. Some people watching thought I was mad,” he recalls. “Then two soldiers appeared in front of me.” Mr Tsimba was arrested and tossed into a makeshift prison cell. When, after four days of drinking dirty water, a senior commander came to question him, Mr Tsimba—in an effort to prove he was sane—claimed that he was collecting the bullets to make kitchen pots. “Then the commander said: ‘OK, tomorrow you will show me how you do it’,” he remembers. 

With the help of two other prisoners, a small fire and an old bicycle (pedalled to fan the flames), Mr Tsimba made a pot. “The commander was happy. He told me: ‘As you work, I’ll find clients to buy the pots. We will make money’.” The artist begged to go home, but his captor insisted he must first make 300 pots. For more than three months Mr Tsimba laboured over the fire. When he had finally delivered his quota, the officer kept his word and freed him. “He gave me ten sacks of bullets to take home,” says Mr Tsimba. “I hid them inside bags of foufou [pounded cassava roots], and transported them back on a boat.” 

Some of these bullets are now in Paris, a few hundred metres from the Eiffel Tower. They have been transformed into a pregnant woman, holding a book sculpted out of 2,000 keys. “The idea is that through knowledge and culture, our country can be renewed,” says Mr Tsimba. The piece, called “Carrier of Lives”, is 4.25 metres tall and stands in the Palais de Chaillot. It was unveiled in December 2018 to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 

Even though Mr Tsimba travels all over the world, exhibiting his work and rubbing shoulders with collectors, he says he will never leave Matongé—his birthplace, as well as where his studio sits. Walking through one of its litter-strewn back-alleys in a beret and overalls, he stops to greet friends and wave at shopkeepers. “I could never leave Kinshasa, [the city] is stronger than me,” he says. “The noise, the calls from people…It would be impossible.”

<h3 id="７.4">The shape-shifting threat of Chinese espionage</h3>

Chinese Communist Espionage: An Intelligence Primer. By Peter Mattis and Matthew Brazil. Naval Institute Press; 384 pages; $45. 

Chinese Spies: From Chairman Mao to Xi Jinping. By Roger Faligot.Hurst; 568 pages; $34.95 and £30. 

THE CHILLING scene seems drawn from a thriller, but was horrifyingly real. One day in 2011 employees of a government ministry in Beijing were forced to watch the execution of a colleague who had been caught spying for the CIA. He was one of around 20 people rounded up as China eviscerated a network of informers. In their new book, Peter Mattis and Matthew Brazil note that the man’s pregnant wife was killed with him. The point of the shocking story is not just to illustrate a catastrophic failure of American intelligence. It captures the grave stakes of a [`clandestine`](   "Something that is clandestine is hidden or kept secret, often because it is illegal. (常指非法地) 暗中的; 秘密的") game played, or fought, by China and the West. 

The rise of China under Xi Jinping has reinvigorated talk about great-power rivalry. In the imagination of many Westerners, the Communist Party of China has taken the place of its Soviet counterpart; China’s Belt and Road projects and overseas students, and Huawei’s telecoms networks, recall cold-war scares. Often, though, the fevered discussion of China’s reach and influence lacks a clear understanding of the tools at its disposal, and of what the modern Communist Party really wants. This fuzziness is especially evident in the realm of espionage. To some, every Chinese traveller is a potential spy; others dismiss fears of rampant Chinese spooks as paranoia. 

As Mr Mattis, a former CIA analyst, and Mr Brazil, a former American army officer and diplomat, point out, China has been playing spy games for decades. Western counter-intelligence agencies have been sounding warnings about them for just as long—if more quietly than today. For much of the cold war, however, the United States and China shared a common adversary in the Soviet Union. Deng Xiaoping even agreed to let America establish listening posts, or “big ears”, in the Xinjiang region of China’s far west to monitor the Soviets. On a visit to Beijing in 1980, Stansfield Turner, then director of the CIA, supposedly wore a fake moustache to evade the KGB. China itself was a much smaller worry. 

Today the scale and intensity of the Sino-Western duel are greater, as are the geopolitical stakes. Chinese espionage is routinely identified by Western security agencies as one of the most serious foreign-intelligence threats. China probably has more intelligence personnel than any other country. Hackers from the People’s Liberation Army and the Ministry of State Security have cracked open sensitive computer networks around the world. These days, China is implicated in the vast majority of commercial-espionage cases prosecuted by federal authorities in America. 

If Western countries have recruited agents in Beijing, meanwhile, the Chinese have reciprocated. In December 2017 two former French intelligence officials were charged with treason after allegedly spying for China. This April a former CIA agent pleaded guilty to conspiring with Chinese operatives, in a case that American officials suspected was linked to the deadly collapse of the agency’s network in China. 

For years America’s spies and their allies took on their Chinese counterparts on the quiet, preferring not to disrupt diplomacy. In any case, this was a slippery adversary to grapple with. In “Chinese Spies: From Chairman Mao to Xi Jinping”, Roger Faligot, a French author, relates the verdict of an FBI spy-hunter: the trouble with the job is that most targets don’t look or act like spies. They are not [`cloak-and-dagger`](  "A cloak-and-dagger activity is one which involves mystery and secrecy. 秘密的; 神秘的") types with handlers, cut-outs and dead drops; rather, they tend to be “academics, students, businessmen or journalists”. 

Poison-tipped umbrellas are no longer the tools of the espionage trade. Instead it relies on employees at American or European technology and defence firms taking home extra files—or photographing a computer screen on their smartphone, as in a recent case involving technology for a self-driving car in which the FBI arrested an engineer at Apple. China also acquires know-how by funding scientists at American institutions; some set up “shadow labs” in China that mirror their work in America. 

Invoking a Chinese term, Mr Faligot describes this multipronged approach to intelligence collection as the “sea-lamprey strategy”. This “slippery, greenish fish blends with the seascape”, then latches on to its prey, “siphoning off its blood through its multiple orifices”, Mr Faligot writes evocatively. Too evocatively, perhaps. Readers of his [`engrossing`](   "Something that is engrossing is very interesting and holds your attention completely. 引人入胜的; 非常有趣的") book might be prone to find Chinese spies everywhere, lurking like “deep-water fish” in Chinese communities from Vancouver to Sydney. 

Under President Donald Trump, America’s authorities have sometimes seemed inclined to do just that. Given China’s strident authoritarianism, the fear is understandable. But the amorphous nature of the threat demands a cool assessment. In their book, Mr Mattis and Mr Brazil provide a useful field guide to Chinese intelligence services, from the distrust and purges that weakened them under Mao to their more professional incarnations today. They also supply an eye-opening compendium of confirmed cases of Chinese skulduggery. Even so, charting the Chinese threat remains a work in progress. 

In many instances it is hard to discern how much damage has really been done by Chinese agents to other national interests, whether in America or elsewhere. Sometimes it is not clear that a Chinese agent is really a “spy”, as opposed to a businessman or student caught up in machinations larger than they appreciate. As the spy games become more complex and sophisticated, blunt crackdowns and blanket suspicions may be as damaging to Western societies—and the rights of innocent people—as naivety is to national security. The shadowy nature of espionage calls for democracies to be extra-vigilant, not only about spies but, just as important, about those responsible for hunting them.

<h3 id="７.5">When the meaning is in the method</h3>

Good Economics for Hard Times. By Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo. PublicAffairs; 432 pages; $30. Allen Lane; £25. 

WHEN THE authors of this excellent book were awarded the Nobel prize for economics last month, French media crowed that a Frenchwoman had won it; Indian media that an Indian-born economist and his wife had done so. Most reports eventually mentioned that their national champion was not the sole laureate. But the [`parochialism`](  "Parochialism is the quality of being parochial in your attitude. 狭隘主意") of the headlines bears out one of the book’s central observations. 

The world is messier than conventional economic models assume. People respond not only to material incentives but also to the pull of tribe and custom. They are not only rational but also emotional, superstitious and attached to the familiar. All economists know that their models oversimplify—that is what models are for. But few have grappled as energetically with the complexity of real life as Esther Duflo and Abhijit Banerjee, or got their boots as dirty in the process. 

The couple are best known, along with their fellow Nobel laureate Michael Kremer, for pioneering the use of randomised controlled trials to answer economic questions. An earlier book, “Poor Economics”, is full of powerful examples. To see whether small loans improve the lives of the poor, the team persuaded a microlender in Hyderabad to expand into some randomly selected districts but not others. (They found that microcredit works, but not as well as its boosters claim.) In another trial, they found that Indian teachers were more likely to show up to work if they were made to take date-stamped photos of themselves, and their pay was docked if they missed classes. 

“Good Economics for Hard Times” is more wide-ranging. It reviews the evidence for what works and what doesn’t in tackling some of the world’s biggest problems, from climate change to trade. The authors admit that their knowledge is imperfect and their proposals will need refining. They don’t claim to understand what causes rapid economic growth, for instance. They would far rather you absorbed their evidence-based, trial-and-error method than any specific policy. 

The result is a treasure trove of insight. They describe how caste politics fosters corruption, how potential migrants can overcome their fear of the unknown, and how, when government posts are excessively well-paid, as they are in several poor countries, fresh graduates remain jobless for years rather than settle for a private-sector position. 

The authors are fascinated by what motivates people, and how this varies by social context. In an experiment involving coin-flipping for cash rewards, Swiss bankers are more likely to cheat if reminded beforehand that they are bankers, less so if they are asked to talk about what they do in their leisure time. In “banker” mode, it seems, people are more ruthlessly acquisitive than when in “volunteer football coach” mode. In a similar experiment, students in India cheated more when reminded that they hoped one day to work for the government; for students in Denmark, the opposite was true. A government’s reputation for corruption or cleanliness “affects the honesty of those who want to work for it”, suggest the authors. 

Thinking about inequality, they are sceptical about the fashionable idea that rich countries should offer every citizen a “universal basic income”. The real crisis in such places is not material deprivation but that “many people who used to think of themselves as middle class have lost the sense of self-worth that they used to derive from their jobs.” In poor countries, by contrast, material deprivation is a huge problem and an “ultra-basic” handout of a dollar or two a day could release people from [`penury`](    "Penury is the state of being extremely poor. 赤贫") and hunger. 

India could largely pay for this by abolishing wasteful subsidies for petrol, food and fertiliser. Universal cash payments are simple—a big plus when the government is incapable of administering complex social programmes. The authors do not imagine, however, that their logical arguments settle the matter. Mr Banerjee is running a randomised trial of ultra-basic cash payments in Kenya; he expects results next year. 

All readers will find something to disagree with in this book. It is too harsh on Margaret Thatcher and too kind to Europe’s farm subsidies. But they will be captivated by the authors’ curiosity, ferocious intellects and attractive modesty. “The only recourse we have against bad ideas”, they argue, is to “resist the seduction of the ‘obvious’, be sceptical of promised miracles, question the evidence, be patient with complexity and honest about what we know and what we can know.” Amen.
